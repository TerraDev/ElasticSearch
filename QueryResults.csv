11227809,1,11227902,,6/27/2012 13:51,,26689,1761310,"<p>Here is a piece of C++ code that shows some very peculiar behavior.</p>
<p>For some reason, sorting the data (<em>before</em> the timed region) miraculously makes the primary loop almost six times faster:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;ctime&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    // Generate data
    const unsigned arraySize = 32768;
    int data[arraySize];

    for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
        data[c] = std::rand() % 256;

    // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster.
    std::sort(data, data + arraySize);

    // Test
    clock_t start = clock();
    long long sum = 0;
    for (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)
    {
        for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
        {   // Primary loop.
            if (data[c] &gt;= 128)
                sum += data[c];

    }

    double elapsedTime = static_cast&lt;double&gt;(clock()-start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

<ul>
<li>Without <code>std::sort(data, data + arraySize);</code>, the code runs in 11.54 seconds.</li>
<li>With the sorted data, the code runs in 1.93 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Sorting itself takes more time than this one pass over the array, so it's not actually worth doing if we needed to calculate this for an unknown array.)</p>

<p>Initially, I thought this might be just a language or compiler anomaly, so I tried Java:</p>
<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>import java.util.Arrays;

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Generate data
        int arraySize = 32768;
        int data[] = new int[arraySize];

        Random rnd = new Random(0);
        for (int c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
            data[c] = rnd.nextInt() % 256;

        // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster
        Arrays.sort(data);

        // Test
        long start = System.nanoTime();
        long sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)
        {
            for (int c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
            {   // Primary loop.
                if (data[c] &gt;= 128)
                    sum += data[c];
            }
        }

        System.out.println((System.nanoTime() - start) / 1000000000.0);
        System.out.println(&quot;sum = &quot; + sum);
    }

6841479,2,,6841333,7/27/2011 8:31,,11694,,"<p>It's a time zone change on December 31st in Shanghai.</p>

<p>See <a href=""http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/clockchange.html?n=237&amp;year=1927"" rel=""noreferrer"">this page</a> for details of 1927 in Shanghai. Basically at midnight at the end of 1927, the clocks went back 5 minutes and 52 seconds. So ""1927-12-31 23:54:08"" actually happened twice, and it looks like Java is parsing it as the <em>later</em> possible instant for that local date/time - hence the difference.</p>

<p>Just another episode in the often weird and wonderful world of time zones.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Stop press! History changes...</p>

<p>The original question would no longer demonstrate quite the same behaviour, if rebuilt with version 2013a of <a href=""https://github.com/nodatime/nodatime/blob/master/src/NodaTime.Demo/StackOverflowExamples.cs#L68"" rel=""noreferrer"">TZDB</a>. In 2013a, the result would be 358 seconds, with a transition time of 23:54:03 instead of 23:54:08.</p>

<p>I only noticed this because I'm collecting questions like this in Noda Time, in the form of <a href=""https://github.com/nodatime/nodatime/blob/master/src/NodaTime.Demo/StackOverflowExamples.cs#L68"" rel=""noreferrer"">unit tests</a>... The test has now been changed, but it just goes to show - not even historical data is safe.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> History has changed again...</p>

<p>In TZDB 2014f, the time of the change has moved to 1900-12-31, and it's now a mere 343 second change (so the time between <code>t</code> and <code>t+1</code> is 344 seconds, if you see what I mean).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> To answer a question around a transition at 1900... it looks like the Java timezone implementation treats <em>all</em> time zones as simply being in their standard time for any instant before the start of 1900 UTC:</p>

<pre><code>import java.util.TimeZone;

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        long startOf1900Utc = -2208988800000L;
        for (String id : TimeZone.getAvailableIDs()) {
            TimeZone zone = TimeZone.getTimeZone(id);
            if (zone.getRawOffset() != zone.getOffset(startOf1900Utc - 1)) {
                System.out.println(id);
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code above produces no output on my Windows machine. So any time zone which has any offset other than its standard one at the start of 1900 will count that as a transition. TZDB itself has some data going back earlier than that, and doesn't rely on any idea of a ""fixed"" standard time (which is what <code>getRawOffset</code> assumes to be a valid concept) so other libraries needn't introduce this artificial transition.</p>

<p>But there's <strong>lots</strong> more to explore, read on...</p>
<hr />
<p>JavaScript has powerful semantics for looping through arrays and array-like objects. I've split the answer into two parts: Options for genuine arrays, and options for things that are just array-<em>like</em>, such as the <code>arguments</code> object, other iterable objects (ES2015+), DOM collections, and so on.</p>
<p>Okay, let's look at our options:</p>
<h2>For Actual Arrays</h2>
<p>You have five options (two supported basically forever, another added by ECMAScript 5 [&quot;ES5&quot;], and two more added in ECMAScript 2015 (&quot;ES2015&quot;, aka &quot;ES6&quot;):</p>
<ol>
<li>Use <code>for-of</code> (use an iterator implicitly) (ES2015+)</li>
<li>Use <code>forEach</code> and related (ES5+)</li>
<li>Use a simple <code>for</code> loop</li>
<li>Use <code>for-in</code> <em>correctly</em></li>
<li>Use an iterator explicitly (ES2015+)</li>
</ol>
<p>(You can see those old specs here: <a href=""http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/"" rel=""noreferrer"">ES5</a>, <a href=""http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">ES2015</a>, but both have been superceded; the current editor's draft is always <a href=""https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Details:</p>
<h3>1. Use <code>for-of</code> (use an iterator implicitly) (ES2015+)</h3>
<p>ES2015 added <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>iterators and iterables</em></a> to JavaScript. Arrays are iterable (so are strings, <code>Map</code>s, and <code>Set</code>s, as well as DOM collections and lists, as you'll see later). Iterable objects provide iterators for their values. The new <code>for-of</code> statement loops through the values returned by an iterator:</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>const a = [""a"", ""b"", ""c""];
for (const element of a) { // You can use `let` instead of `const` if you like
    console.log(element);
}
// a
// b
// c</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>It doesn't get simpler than that! Under the covers, that gets an iterator from the array and loops through the values the iterator returns. The iterator provided by arrays provides the values of the array elements, in order beginning to end.</p>
<p>Notice how <code>element</code> is scoped to each loop iteration; trying to use <code>element</code> after the end of the loop would fail because it doesn't exist outside the loop body.</p>
<p>In theory, a <code>for-of</code> loop involves several function calls (one to get the iterator, then one to get each value from it). Even when that's true, it's nothing to worry about, function calls are <em><strong>very</strong></em> cheap in modern JavaScript engines (it bothered me for <code>forEach</code> [below] until I looked into it; <a href=""http://blog.niftysnippets.org/2012/02/foreach-and-runtime-cost.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">details</a>). But additionally, JavaScript engines optimize those calls away (in performance-critical code) when dealing with native iterators for things like arrays.</p>
<p><code>for-of</code> is entirely <code>async</code>-friendly. If you need the work in a loop body to be done in series (not in parallel), an <code>await</code> in the loop body will wait for the promise to settle before continuing. Here's a silly example:</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""true"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code snippet-currently-hidden"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>function delay(ms) {
    return new Promise(resolve =&gt; {
        setTimeout(resolve, ms);
    });
}

async function showSlowly(messages) {
    for (const message of messages) {
        await delay(400);
        console.log(message);
    }
}

showSlowly([
    ""So"", ""long"", ""and"", ""thanks"", ""for"", ""all"", ""the"", ""fish!""
]);
// `.catch` omitted because we know it never rejects</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>Note how the words appear with a delay before each one.</p>
<p>It's a matter of coding style, but <code>for-of</code> is the first thing I reach for when looping through anything iterable.</p>
<h3>2. Use <code>forEach</code> and related</h3>
<p>In any even vaguely-modern environment (so, not IE8) where you have access to the <code>Array</code> features added by ES5, you can use <code>forEach</code> (<a href=""https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-array.prototype.foreach"" rel=""noreferrer"">spec</a> | <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach"" rel=""noreferrer"">MDN</a>) if you're only dealing with synchronous code (or you don't need to wait for an asynchronous process to finish during the loop):</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>const a = [""a"", ""b"", ""c""];
a.forEach((element) =&gt; {
    console.log(element);
});</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p><code>forEach</code> accepts a callback function and, optionally, a value to use as <code>this</code> when calling that callback (not used above). The callback is called for each element in the array, in order, skipping non-existent elements in sparse arrays. Although I only used one parameter above, the callback is called with three arguments: The element for that iteration, the index of that element, and a reference to the array you're iterating over (in case your function doesn't already have it handy).</p>
<p>Like <code>for-of</code>, <code>forEach</code> has the advantage that you don't have to declare indexing and value variables in the containing scope; in this case, they're supplied as arguments to the iteration function, and so nicely scoped to just that iteration.</p>
<p>Unlike <code>for-of</code>, <code>forEach</code> has the disadvantage that it doesn't understand <code>async</code> functions and <code>await</code>. If you use an <code>async</code> function as the callback, <code>forEach</code> does <strong>not</strong> wait for that function's promise to settle before continuing. Here's the <code>async</code> example from <code>for-of</code> using <code>forEach</code> instead — notice how there's an initial delay, but then all the text appears right away instead of waiting:</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""true"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code snippet-currently-hidden"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>function delay(ms) {
    return new Promise(resolve =&gt; {
        setTimeout(resolve, ms);
    });
}

async function showSlowly(messages) {

<p><code>forEach</code> is the &quot;loop through them all&quot; function, but ES5 defined several other useful &quot;work your way through the array and do things&quot; functions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>every</code> (<a href=""https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-array.prototype.every"" rel=""noreferrer"">spec</a> | <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every"" rel=""noreferrer"">MDN</a>) - stops looping the first time the callback returns a falsy value</li>
<li><code>some</code> (<a href=""https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-array.prototype.some"" rel=""noreferrer"">spec</a> | <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some"" rel=""noreferrer"">MDN</a>) - stops looping the first time the callback returns a truthy value</li>
<li><code>filter</code> (<a href=""https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-array.prototype.filter"" rel=""noreferrer"">spec</a> | <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter"" rel=""noreferrer"">MDN</a>) - creates a new array including elements where the callback returns a truthy value, omitting the ones where it doesn't</li>
<li><code>map</code> (<a href=""https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-array.prototype.map"" rel=""noreferrer"">spec</a> | <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map"" rel=""noreferrer"">MDN</a>) - creates a new array from the values returned by the callback</li>
<li><code>reduce</code> (<a href=""https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-array.prototype.reduce"" rel=""noreferrer"">spec</a> | <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce"" rel=""noreferrer"">MDN</a>) - builds up a value by repeatedly calling the callback, passing in previous values; see the spec for the details</li>
<li><code>reduceRight</code> (<a href=""https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-array.prototype.reduceright"" rel=""noreferrer"">spec</a> | <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduceRight"" rel=""noreferrer"">MDN</a>) - like <code>reduce</code>, but works in descending rather than ascending order</li>
</ul>
<p>As with <code>forEach</code>, if you use an <code>async</code> function as your callback, none of those waits for the function's promise to settle. That means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using an <code>async</code> function callback is never appropriate with <code>every</code>, <code>some</code>, and <code>filter</code> since they will treat the returned promise as though it were a truthy value; they <strong>don't</strong> wait for the promise to settle and then use the fulfillment value.</li>
<li>Using an <code>async</code> function callback is often appropriate with <code>map</code>, <strong>if</strong> the goal is to turn an array of something into an array of <em>promises</em>, perhaps for passing to one of the promise combinator functions (<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Promise.all</code></a>, <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Promise.race</code></a>, <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/allSettled"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>promise.allSettled</code></a>, or <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/any"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Promise.any</code></a>).</li>
<li>Using an <code>async</code> function callback is rarely appropriate with <code>reduce</code> or <code>reduceRight</code>, because (again) the callback will always return a promise. But there is an idiom of building a chain of promises from an array that uses <code>reduce</code> (<code>const promise = array.reduce((p, element) =&gt; p.then(/*...something using `element`...*/));</code>), but usually in those cases a <code>for-of</code> or <code>for</code> loop in an <code>async</code> function will be clearer and easier to debug.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Use a simple <code>for</code> loop</h3>
<p>Sometimes the old ways are the best:</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>const a = [""a"", ""b"", ""c""];
for (let index = 0; index &lt; a.length; ++index) {
    const element = a[index];
    console.log(element);
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>If the length of the array won't change during the loop, and it's in highly performance-sensitive code, a slightly more complicated version grabbing the length up front might be a <em><strong>tiny</strong></em> bit faster:</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>const a = [""a"", ""b"", ""c""];
for (let index = 0, len = a.length; index &lt; len; ++index) {
    const element = a[index];
    console.log(element);
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>And/or counting backward:</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>const a = [""a"", ""b"", ""c""];
for (let index = a.length - 1; index &gt;= 0; --index) {
    const element = a[index];
    console.log(element);
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>But with modern JavaScript engines, it's rare you need to eke out that last bit of juice.</p>
<p>Before ES2015, the loop variable had to exist in the containing scope, because <code>var</code> only has function-level scope, not block-level scope. But as you saw in the examples above, you can use <code>let</code> within the <code>for</code> to scope the variables to just the loop. And when you do that, the <code>index</code> variable is recreated for each loop iteration, meaning closures created in the loop body keep a reference to the <code>index</code> for that specific iteration, which solves the old &quot;closures in loops&quot; problem:</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""true"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code snippet-currently-hidden"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>// (The `NodeList` from `querySelectorAll` is array-like)
const divs = document.querySelectorAll(""div"");
for (let index = 0; index &lt; divs.length; ++index) {
    divs[index].addEventListener('click', e =&gt; {
        console.log(""Index is: "" + index);
    });
}</code></pre>
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div&gt;zero&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;one&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;two&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;three&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;four&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>In the above, you get &quot;Index is: 0&quot; if you click the first and &quot;Index is: 4&quot; if you click the last. This does <strong>not</strong> work if you use <code>var</code> instead of <code>let</code> (you'd always see &quot;Index is: 5&quot;).</p>
<p>Like <code>for-of</code>, <code>for</code> loops work well in <code>async</code> functions. Here's the earlier example using a <code>for</code> loop:</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""true"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code snippet-currently-hidden"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>function delay(ms) {
    return new Promise(resolve =&gt; {
        setTimeout(resolve, ms);
    });
}

async function showSlowly(messages) {
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; messages.length; ++i) {
        const message = messages[i];
        await delay(400);
        console.log(message);
    }
}

showSlowly([
    ""So"", ""long"", ""and"", ""thanks"", ""for"", ""all"", ""the"", ""fish!""
]);
// `.catch` omitted because we know it never rejects</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<h3>4. Use <code>for-in</code> <em>correctly</em></h3>
<p><code>for-in</code> isn't for looping through arrays, it's for looping through the names of an object's properties. It does often seem to work for looping through arrays as a by-product of the fact that arrays are objects, but it doesn't just loop through the array indexes, it loops through <strong>all</strong> enumerable properties of the object (including inherited ones). (It also used to be that the order wasn't specified; it is now [details in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/30919039/157247"">this other answer</a>], but even though the order is specified now, the rules are complex, there are exceptions, and relying on the order is not best practice.)</p>
<p>The only real use cases for <code>for-in</code> on an array are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_array"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>sparse</em> array</a> with <strong>massive</strong> gaps in it, or</li>
<li>You're using non-element properties on the array object and you want to include them in the loop</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking only at that first example: You can use <code>for-in</code> to visit those sparse array elements if you use appropriate safeguards:</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>// `a` is a sparse array
const a = [];
a[0] = ""a"";
a[10] = ""b"";
a[10000] = ""c"";
for (const name in a) {
    if (Object.hasOwn(a, name) &amp;&amp;       // These checks are
        /^0$|^[1-9]\d*$/.test(name) &amp;&amp;  // explained
        name &lt;= 4294967294              // below
       ) {
        const element = a[name];
        console.log(a[name]);
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>Note the three checks:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>That the object has its <em>own</em> property by that name (not one it inherits from its prototype; this check is also often written as <code>a.hasOwnProperty(name)</code> but ES2022 adds <a href=""https://github.com/tc39/proposal-accessible-object-hasownproperty"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Object.hasOwn</code></a> which can be more reliable), and</p>
</li>
<li><p>That the name is all decimal digits (e.g., normal string form, not scientific notation), and</p>
</li>
<li><p>That the name's value when coerced to a number is &lt;= 2^32 - 2 (which is 4,294,967,294). Where does that number come from? It's part of the definition of an array index <a href=""https://tc39.es/ecma262/#array-index"" rel=""noreferrer"">in the specification</a>. Other numbers (non-integers, negative numbers, numbers greater than 2^32 - 2) are not array indexes. The reason it's 2^32 - <strong>2</strong> is that that makes the greatest index value one lower than 2^32 - <strong>1</strong>, which is the maximum value an array's <code>length</code> can have. (E.g., an array's length fits in a 32-bit unsigned integer.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>...although with that said, most code only does the <code>hasOwnProperty</code> check.</p>
<p>You wouldn't do that in inline code, of course. You'd write a utility function. Perhaps:</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""true"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code snippet-currently-hidden"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>// Utility function for antiquated environments without `forEach`
const hasOwn = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call.bind(Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty);
const rexNum = /^0$|^[1-9]\d*$/;
function sparseEach(array, callback, thisArg) {
    for (const name in array) {
        const index = +name;
        if (hasOwn(a, name) &amp;&amp;
            rexNum.test(name) &amp;&amp;
            index &lt;= 4294967294
           ) {
            callback.call(thisArg, array[name], index, array);
        }
    }
}

const a = [];
a[5] = ""five"";
a[10] = ""ten"";
a[100000] = ""one hundred thousand"";
a.b = ""bee"";

sparseEach(a, (value, index) =&gt; {
    console.log(""Value at "" + index + "" is "" + value);
});</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>Like <code>for</code>, <code>for-in</code> works well in asynchronous functions if the work within it needs to be done in series.</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""true"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code snippet-currently-hidden"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>function delay(ms) {
    return new Promise(resolve =&gt; {
        setTimeout(resolve, ms);
    });
}

async function showSlowly(messages) {
    for (const name in messages) {
        if (messages.hasOwnProperty(name)) { // Almost always this is the only check people do
            const message = messages[name];
            await delay(400);
            console.log(message);
        }
    }
}

showSlowly([
    ""So"", ""long"", ""and"", ""thanks"", ""for"", ""all"", ""the"", ""fish!""
]);
// `.catch` omitted because we know it never rejects</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<h3>5. Use an iterator explicitly (ES2015+)</h3>
<p><code>for-of</code> uses an iterator implicitly, doing all the scut work for you. Sometimes, you might want to use an iterator <em>explicitly</em>. It looks like this:</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>const a = [""a"", ""b"", ""c""];
const it = a.values(); // Or `const it = a[Symbol.iterator]();` if you like
let entry;
while (!(entry = it.next()).done) {
    const element = entry.value;
    console.log(element);
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>An iterator is an object matching the Iterator definition in the specification. Its <code>next</code> method returns a new <em>result object</em> each time you call it. The result object has a property, <code>done</code>, telling us whether it's done, and a property <code>value</code> with the value for that iteration. (<code>done</code> is optional if it would be <code>false</code>, <code>value</code> is optional if it would be <code>undefined</code>.)</p>
<p>What you get for <code>value</code> varies depending on the iterator. On arrays, the default iterator provides the value of each array element (<code>&quot;a&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;b&quot;</code>, and <code>&quot;c&quot;</code> in the example earlier). Arrays also have three other methods that return iterators:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>values()</code>: This is an alias for the <code>[Symbol.iterator]</code> method that returns the default iterator.</li>
<li><code>keys()</code>: Returns an iterator that provides each key (index) in the array. In the example above, it would provide <code>&quot;0&quot;</code>, then <code>&quot;1&quot;</code>, then <code>&quot;2&quot;</code> (yes, as strings).</li>
<li><code>entries()</code>: Returns an iterator that provides <code>[key, value]</code> arrays.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since iterator objects don't advance until you call <code>next</code>, they work well in <code>async</code> function loops. Here's the earlier <code>for-of</code> example using the iterator explicitly:</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""true"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code snippet-currently-hidden"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>function delay(ms) {
    return new Promise(resolve =&gt; {
        setTimeout(resolve, ms);
    });
}

async function showSlowly(messages) {
    const it = messages.values()
    while (!(entry = it.next()).done) {
        await delay(400);
        const element = entry.value;
        console.log(element);
    }
}

showSlowly([
    ""So"", ""long"", ""and"", ""thanks"", ""for"", ""all"", ""the"", ""fish!""
]);
// `.catch` omitted because we know it never rejects</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<h2>For Array-Like Objects</h2>
<p>Aside from true arrays, there are also <em>array-like</em> objects that have a <code>length</code> property and properties with all-digits names: <a href=""https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-nodelist"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>NodeList</code> instances</a>, <a href=""https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-htmlcollection"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>HTMLCollection</code> instances</a>, the <code>arguments</code> object, etc. How do we loop through their contents?</p>
<h3>Use most of the options above</h3>
<p>At least some, and possibly most or even all, of the array approaches above apply equally well to array-like objects:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Use <code>for-of</code> (use an iterator implicitly) (ES2015+)</strong></p>
<p><code>for-of</code> uses the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols"" rel=""noreferrer"">iterator</a> provided by the object (if any). That includes host-provided objects (like DOM collections and lists). For instance, <code>HTMLCollection</code> instances from <code>getElementsByXYZ</code> methods and <code>NodeList</code>s instances from <code>querySelectorAll</code> both support iteration. (This is defined <strong>quite</strong> subtly by the HTML and DOM specifications. Basically, any object with <code>length</code> and indexed access is automatically iterable. It <strong>doesn't</strong> have to be marked <code>iterable</code>; that is used only for collections that, in addition to being iterable, support <code>forEach</code>, <code>values</code>, <code>keys</code>, and <code>entries</code> methods. <code>NodeList</code> does; <code>HTMLCollection</code> doesn't, but both are iterable.)</p>
<p>Here's an example of looping through <code>div</code> elements:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""true"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code snippet-currently-hidden"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>const divs = document.querySelectorAll(""div"");
for (const div of divs) {
    div.textContent = Math.random();
}</code></pre>
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div&gt;zero&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;one&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;two&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;three&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;four&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<ol start=""2"">
<li><p><strong>Use <code>forEach</code> and related (ES5+)</strong></p>
<p>The various functions on <code>Array.prototype</code> are &quot;intentionally generic&quot; and can be used on array-like objects via <code>Function#call</code> (<a href=""https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-function.prototype.call"" rel=""noreferrer"">spec</a> | <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call"" rel=""noreferrer"">MDN</a>) or <code>Function#apply</code> (<a href=""https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-function.prototype.apply"" rel=""noreferrer"">spec</a> | <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply"" rel=""noreferrer"">MDN</a>). (If you have to deal with IE8 or earlier [ouch], see the &quot;Caveat for host-provided objects&quot; at the end of this answer, but it's not an issue with vaguely-modern browsers.)</p>
<p>Suppose you wanted to use <code>forEach</code> on a <code>Node</code>'s <code>childNodes</code> collection (which, being an <code>HTMLCollection</code>, doesn't have <code>forEach</code> natively). You'd do this:</p>
<pre><code>Array.prototype.forEach.call(node.childNodes, (child) =&gt; {
    // Do something with `child`
});
</code></pre>
<p>(Note, though, that you could just use <code>for-of</code> on <code>node.childNodes</code>.)</p>
<p>If you're going to do that a lot, you might want to grab a copy of the function reference into a variable for reuse, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>// (This is all presumably in a module or some scoping function)
const forEach = Array.prototype.forEach.call.bind(Array.prototype.forEach);

// Then later...
forEach(node.childNodes, (child) =&gt; {
    // Do something with `child`
});
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use a simple <code>for</code> loop</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps obviously, a simple <code>for</code> loop works for array-like objects.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use an iterator explicitly (ES2015+)</strong></p>
<p>See #1.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You <em><strong>may</strong></em> be able to get away with <code>for-in</code> (with safeguards), but with all of these more appropriate options, there's no reason to try.</p>
<h3>Create a true array</h3>
<p>Other times, you may want to convert an array-like object into a true array. Doing that is surprisingly easy:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Use <code>Array.from</code></strong></p>
<p><code>Array.from</code> <a href=""https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-array.from"" rel=""noreferrer"">(spec)</a> | <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from"" rel=""noreferrer"">(MDN)</a> (ES2015+, but easily polyfilled) creates an array from an array-like object, optionally passing the entries through a mapping function first. So:</p>
<pre><code>const divs = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(&quot;div&quot;));
</code></pre>
<p>...takes the <code>NodeList</code> from <code>querySelectorAll</code> and makes an array from it.</p>
<p>The mapping function is handy if you were going to map the contents in some way. For instance, if you wanted to get an array of the tag names of the elements with a given class:</p>
<pre><code>// Typical use (with an arrow function):
const divs = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(&quot;.some-class&quot;), element =&gt; element.tagName);

// Traditional function (since `Array.from` can be polyfilled):
var divs = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(&quot;.some-class&quot;), function(element) {
    return element.tagName;
});
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use spread syntax (<code>...</code>)</strong></p>
<p>It's also possible to use ES2015's <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax"" rel=""noreferrer"">spread syntax</a>. Like <code>for-of</code>, this uses the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols"" rel=""noreferrer"">iterator</a> provided by the object (see #1 in the previous section):</p>
<pre><code>const trueArray = [...iterableObject];
</code></pre>
<p>So for instance, if we want to convert a <code>NodeList</code> into a true array, with spread syntax this becomes quite succinct:</p>
<pre><code>const divs = [...document.querySelectorAll(&quot;div&quot;)];
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use the <code>slice</code> method of arrays</strong></p>
<p>We can use the <a href=""https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-array.prototype.slice"" rel=""noreferrer""><co",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e>slice</code></a> method of arrays, which like the other methods mentioned above is &quot;intentionally generic&quot; and so can be used with array-like objects, like this:</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
<pre><code>const trueArray = Array.prototype.slice.call(arrayLikeObject);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
</code></pre>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
<p>So for instance, if we want to convert a <code>NodeList</code> into a true array, we could do this:</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
<pre><code>const divs = Array.prototype.slice.call(document.querySelectorAll(&quot;div&quot;));,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
</code></pre>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
<p>(If you still have to handle IE8 [ouch], will fail; IE8 didn't let you use host-provided objects as <code>this</code> like that.)</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
</li>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
</ol>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
<h3>Caveat for host-provided objects</h3>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
<p>If you use <code>Array.prototype</code> functions with <em>host-provided</em> array-like objects (for example, DOM collections and such provided by the browser rather than the JavaScript engine), obsolete browsers like IE8 didn't necessarily handle that way, so if you have to support them, be sure to test in your target environments. But it's not an issue with vaguely-modern browsers. (For non-browser environments, naturally it'll depend on the environment.)</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

<li>I won't tolerate any racist, sexist, bullying (especially of newbies) or other forms of impoliteness. Disagree with others for sure, but respect and civility must be maintained at all times (and some humor is good too!)</li>
<li>Like good code, answers and especially questions should be a brief as possible (without losing meaning or legibility). Reflect that <strong>we're building a knowledge base here, not a blog site</strong>. I will guide users to this end</li>
<li>Migration to other forums is another bugbear of mine. Often there are questions that are good questions, but belong elsewhere. I'll do my best to migrate them appropriately</li>
<li>I'll turn up every day and do the job</li>

<p><em>→ If you already understand the problem, skip to the possible solutions below.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h1>The problem</h1>
<p>The <strong>A</strong> in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ajax</a> stands for <a href=""https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/asynchronous"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>asynchronous</strong></a>. That means sending the request (or rather receiving the response) is taken out of the normal execution flow. In your example, <code>$.ajax</code> returns immediately and the next statement, <code>return result;</code>, is executed before the function you passed as <code>success</code> callback was even called.</p>
<p>Here is an analogy which hopefully makes the difference between synchronous and asynchronous flow clearer:</p>
<h2>Synchronous</h2>
<p>Imagine you make a phone call to a friend and ask him to look something up for you. Although it might take a while, you wait on the phone and stare into space, until your friend gives you the answer that you needed.</p>
<p>The same is happening when you make a function call containing &quot;normal&quot; code:</p>
<pre><code>function findItem() {
    var item;
    while(item_not_found) {
        // search
    }
    return item;
}

var item = findItem();

// Do something with item
doSomethingElse();
</code></pre>
<p>Even though <code>findItem</code> might take a long time to execute, any code coming after <code>var item = findItem();</code> has to <em>wait</em> until the function returns the result.</p>
<h2>Asynchronous</h2>
<p>You call your friend again for the same reason. But this time you tell him that you are in a hurry and he should <em>call you back</em> on your mobile phone. You hang up, leave the house, and do whatever you planned to do. Once your friend calls you back, you are dealing with the information he gave to you.</p>
<p>That's exactly what's happening when you do an Ajax request.</p>
<pre><code>findItem(function(item) {
    // Do something with the item
});
doSomethingElse();
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of waiting for the response, the execution continues immediately and the statement after the Ajax call is executed. To get the response eventually, you provide a function to be called once the response was received, a <em>callback</em> (notice something? <em>call back</em> ?). Any statement coming after that call is executed before the callback is called.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Solution(s)</h1>
<p><strong>Embrace the asynchronous nature of JavaScript!</strong> While certain asynchronous operations provide synchronous counterparts (so does &quot;Ajax&quot;), it's generally discouraged to use them, especially in a browser context.</p>
<p>Why is it bad do you ask?</p>
<p>JavaScript runs in the UI thread of the browser and any long-running process will lock the UI, making it unresponsive. Additionally, there is an upper limit on the execution time for JavaScript and the browser will ask the user whether to continue the execution or not.</p>
<p>All of this results in a really bad user experience. The user won't be able to tell whether everything is working fine or not. Furthermore, the effect will be worse for users with a slow connection.</p>
<p>In the following we will look at three different solutions that are all building on top of each other:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Promises with <code>async/await</code></strong> (ES2017+, available in older browsers if you use a transpiler or regenerator)</li>
<li><strong>Callbacks</strong> (popular in node)</li>
<li><strong>Promises with <code>then()</code></strong> (ES2015+, available in older browsers if you use one of the many promise libraries)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All three are available in current browsers, and node 7+.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2>ES2017+: Promises with <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>async/await</code></a></h2>
<p>The ECMAScript version released in 2017 introduced <em>syntax-level support</em> for asynchronous functions. With the help of <code>async</code> and <code>await</code>, you can write asynchronous in a &quot;synchronous style&quot;. The code is still asynchronous, but it's easier to read/understand.</p>
<p><code>async/await</code> builds on top of promises: an <code>async</code> function always returns a promise. <code>await</code> &quot;unwraps&quot; a promise and either result in the value the promise was resolved with or throws an error if the promise was rejected.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> You can only use <code>await</code> inside an <code>async</code> function or in a <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules"" rel=""noreferrer"">JavaScript module</a>. Top-level <code>await</code> is not supported outside of modules, so you might have to make an async IIFE (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately_invoked_function_expression"" rel=""noreferrer"">Immediately Invoked Function Expression</a>) to start an <code>async</code> context if not using a module.</p>
<p>You can read more about <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>async</code></a> and <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>await</code></a> on MDN.</p>
<p>Here is an example that elaborates the <em>delay</em> function <code>findItem()</code> above:</p>
<pre><code>// Using 'superagent' which will return a promise.
var superagent = require('superagent')

// This is isn't declared as `async` because it already returns a promise
function delay() {
  // `delay` returns a promise
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    // Only `delay` is able to resolve or reject the promise
    setTimeout(function() {
      resolve(42); // After 3 seconds, resolve the promise with value 42
    }, 3000);
  });
}

async function getAllBooks() {
  try {
    // GET a list of book IDs of the current user
    var bookIDs = await superagent.get('/user/books');
    // wait for 3 seconds (just for the sake of this example)
    await delay();
    // GET information about each book
    return superagent.get('/books/ids='+JSON.stringify(bookIDs));
  } catch(error) {
    // If any of the awaited promises was rejected, this catch block
    // would catch the rejection reason
    return null;
  }
}

// Start an IIFE to use `await` at the top level
(async function(){
  let books = await getAllBooks();
  console.log(books);
})();
</code></pre>
<p>Current <a href=""https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus/#test-async_functions"" rel=""noreferrer"">browser</a> and <a href=""http://node.green/#ES2017-features-async-functions"" rel=""noreferrer"">node</a> versions support <code>async/await</code>. You can also support older environments by transforming your code to ES5 with the help of <a href=""https://github.com/facebook/regenerator"" rel=""noreferrer"">regenerator</a> (or tools that use regenerator, such as <a href=""https://babeljs.io/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Babel</a>).</p>
<hr />
<h2>Let functions accept <em>callbacks</em></h2>
<p>A callback is when function 1 is passed to function 2. Function 2 can call function 1 whenever it is ready. In the context of an asynchronous process, the callback will be called whenever the asynchronous process is done. Usually, the result is passed to the callback.</p>
<p>In the example of the question, you can make <code>foo</code> accept a callback and use it as <code>success</code> callback. So this</p>
<pre><code>var result = foo();
// Code that depends on 'result'
</code></pre>
<p>becomes</p>
<pre><code>foo(function(result) {
    // Code that depends on 'result'
});
</code></pre>
<p>Here we defined the function &quot;inline&quot; but you can pass any function reference:</p>
<pre><code>function myCallback(result) {
    // Code that depends on 'result'
}

foo(myCallback);
</code></pre>
<p><code>foo</code> itself is defined as follows:</p>
<pre><code>function foo(callback) {
    $.ajax({
        // ...
        success: callback
    });
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>callback</code> will refer to the function we pass to <code>foo</code> when we call it and we pass it on to <code>success</code>. I.e. once the Ajax request is successful, <code>$.ajax</code> will call <code>callback</code> and pass the response to the callback (which can be referred to with <code>result</code>, since this is how we defined the callback).</p>
<p>You can also process the response before passing it to the callback:</p>
<pre><code>function foo(callback) {
    $.ajax({
        // ...
        success: function(response) {
            // For example, filter the response
            callback(filtered_response);
        }
    });
}
</code></pre>
<p>It's easier to write code using callbacks than it may seem. After all, JavaScript in the browser is heavily event-driven (DOM events). Receiving the Ajax response is nothing else but an event.
Difficulties could arise when you have to work with third-party code, but most problems can be solved by just thinking through the application flow.</p>

<h2>ES2015+: Promises with <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise"" rel=""noreferrer"">then()</a></h2>
<p>The <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise"" rel=""noreferrer"">Promise API</a> is a new feature of ECMAScript 6 (ES2015), but it has good <a href=""http://caniuse.com/#feat=promises"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""caniuse"">browser support</a> already. There are also many libraries which implement the standard Promises API and provide additional methods to ease the use and composition of asynchronous functions (e.g., <a href=""https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird"" rel=""noreferrer"">bluebird</a>).</p>
<p>Promises are containers for <em>future</em> values. When the promise receives the value (it is <em>resolved</em>) or when it is canceled (<em>rejected</em>), it notifies all of its &quot;listeners&quot; who want to access this value.</p>
<p>The advantage over plain callbacks is that they allow you to decouple your code and they are easier to compose.</p>
<p>Here is an example of using a promise:</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>function delay() {
  // `delay` returns a promise
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    // Only `delay` is able to resolve or reject the promise
    setTimeout(function() {
      resolve(42); // After 3 seconds, resolve the promise with value 42
    }, 3000);
  });
}

delay()
  .then(function(v) { // `delay` returns a promise
    console.log(v); // Log the value once it is resolved
  })
  .catch(function(v) {
    // Or do something else if it is rejected
    // (it would not happen in this example, since `reject` is not called).
  });</code></pre>
<pre class=""snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; top: 0; }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>Applied to our Ajax call we could use promises like this:</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>function ajax(url) {
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.onload = function() {
      resolve(this.responseText);
    };
    xhr.onerror = reject;
    xhr.open('GET', url);
    xhr.send();
  });
}

ajax(""https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1"")
  .then(function(result) {
    console.log(result); // Code depending on result
  })
  .catch(function() {
    // An error occurred
  });</code></pre>
<pre class=""snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; top: 0; }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>Describing all the advantages that promise offer is beyond the scope of this answer, but if you write new code, you should seriously consider them. They provide a great abstraction and separation of your code.</p>

<h3>Side note: jQuery's deferred objects</h3>
<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4866721/what-are-deferred-objects"">Deferred objects</a> are jQuery's custom implementation of promises (before the Promise API was standardized). They behave almost like promises but expose a slightly different API.</p>
<p>Every Ajax method of jQuery already returns a &quot;deferred object&quot; (actually a promise of a deferred object) which you can just return from your function:</p>
<pre><code>function ajax() {
    return $.ajax(...);
}

ajax().done(function(result) {
    // Code depending on result
}).fail(function() {
    // An error occurred
});
</code></pre>
<h3>Side note: Promise gotchas</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that promises and deferred objects are just <em>containers</em> for a future value, they are not the value itself. For example, suppose you had the following:</p>
<pre><code>function checkPassword() {
    return $.ajax({
        url: '/password',
        data: {
            username: $('#username').val(),
            password: $('#password').val()
        },
        type: 'POST',
        dataType: 'json'
    });
}

if (checkPassword()) {
    // Tell the user they're logged in
}
</code></pre>
<p>This code misunderstands the above asynchronous issues. Specifically, <code>$.ajax()</code> doesn't freeze the code while it checks the '/password' page on your server - it sends a request to the server and while it waits, it immediately returns a jQuery Ajax Deferred object, not the response from the server. That means the <code>if</code> statement is going to always get this Deferred object, treat it as <code>true</code>, and proceed as though the user is logged in. Not good.</p>
<p>But the fix is easy:</p>
<pre><code>checkPassword()
.done(function(r) {
    if (r) {
        // Tell the user they're logged in
    } else {
        // Tell the user their password was bad
    }
})
.fail(function(x) {
    // Tell the user something bad happened
});
</code></pre>
<hr />
<h2>Not recommended: Synchronous &quot;Ajax&quot; calls</h2>
<p>As I mentioned, some(!) asynchronous operations have synchronous counterparts. I don't advocate their use, but for completeness' sake, here is how you would perform a synchronous call:</p>
<h3>Without jQuery</h3>
<p>If you directly use a <a href=""https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>XMLHttpRequest</code></a> object, pass <code>false</code> as third argument to <a href=""https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#the-open()-method"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>.open</code></a>.</p>
<h3>jQuery</h3>
<p>If you use <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/"" rel=""noreferrer"">jQuery</a>, you can set the <code>async</code> option to <code>false</code>. Note that this option is <em>deprecated</em> since jQuery 1.8.
You can then either still use a <code>success</code> callback or access the <code>responseText</code> property of the <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR"" rel=""noreferrer"">jqXHR object</a>:</p>
<pre><code>function foo() {
    var jqXHR = $.ajax({
        //...
        async: false
    });
    return jqXHR.responseText;
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you use any other jQuery Ajax method, such as <code>$.get</code>, <code>$.getJSON</code>, etc., you have to change it to <code>$.ajax</code> (since you can only pass configuration parameters to <code>$.ajax</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Heads up!</strong> It is not possible to make a synchronous <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2067472/please-explain-jsonp"">JSONP</a> request. JSONP by its very nature is always asynchronous (one more reason to not even consider this option).</p>

<td>Andrew Koenig and Barbara Moo, 1st Edition - August 24, 2000</td>
<td>This basically covers the same ground as the <em>C++ Primer</em>, but does so in a quarter of its space. This is largely because it does not attempt to be an introduction to <em>programming</em>, but an introduction to <em>C++</em> for people who've previously programmed in some other language. It has a steeper learning curve, but, for those who can cope with this, it is a very compact introduction to the language. (Historically, it broke new ground by being the first beginner's book to use a modern approach to teaching the language.) Despite this, the C++ it teaches is purely C++98.</td>

It presents ~50 easy-to-remember rules of thumb along with their rationale in a very accessible (and enjoyable) style. For C++11 and C++14 the examples and a few issues are outdated and Effective Modern C++ should be preferred.</td>

It is a comprehensive and very detailed book that tried to explain and make use of all the features available in C++, in the context of numerical methods. It introduced at the time several new techniques, such as the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP, also called Barton-Nackman trick).
It pioneered several techniques such as dimensional analysis and automatic differentiation.
It came with a lot of compilable and useful code, ranging from an expression parser to a Lapack wrapper.
The code is <a href=""//www.informit.com/store/scientific-and-engineering-c-plus-plus-an-introduction-9780201533934"" rel=""noreferrer"">still available online</a>.
Unfortunately, the books have become somewhat outdated in the style and C++ features, however, it was an incredible tour-de-force at the time (1994, pre-STL).
The chapters on dynamics inheritance are a bit complicated to understand and not very useful.
An updated version of this classic book that includes move semantics and the lessons learned from the STL would be very nice.</p>

<p>A week later, you return to the hotel, do not check in, sneak into your old room with your stolen key, and look in the drawer. Your book is still there. Astonishing!</p>

<p><strong>How can that be? Aren't the contents of a hotel room drawer inaccessible if you haven't rented the room?</strong></p>

<p>Well, obviously that scenario can happen in the real world no problem. There is no mysterious force that causes your book to disappear when you are no longer authorized to be in the room. Nor is there a mysterious force that prevents you from entering a room with a stolen key.</p>

<p>The hotel management is not <em>required</em> to remove your book. You didn't make a contract with them that said that if you leave stuff behind, they'll shred it for you. If you illegally re-enter your room with a stolen key to get it back, the hotel security staff is not <em>required</em> to catch you sneaking in. You didn't make a contract with them that said ""if I try to sneak back into my room later, you are required to stop me."" Rather, you signed a contract with them that said ""I promise not to sneak back into my room later"", a contract which <em>you broke</em>.</p>

<p>In this situation <strong>anything can happen</strong>. The book can be there -- you got lucky. Someone else's book can be there and yours could be in the hotel's furnace. Someone could be there right when you come in, tearing your book to pieces. The hotel could have removed the table and book entirely and replaced it with a wardrobe. The entire hotel could be just about to be torn down and replaced with a football stadium, and you are going to die in an explosion while you are sneaking around. </p>

<p>You don't know what is going to happen; when you checked out of the hotel and stole a key to illegally use later, you gave up the right to live in a predictable, safe world because <em>you</em> chose to break the rules of the system.</p>

<p><strong>C++ is not a safe language</strong>. It will cheerfully allow you to break the rules of the system. If you try to do something illegal and foolish like going back into a room you're not authorized to be in and rummaging through a desk that might not even be there anymore, C++ is not going to stop you. Safer languages than C++ solve this problem by restricting your power -- by having much stricter control over keys, for example.</p>

<h2>UPDATE</h2>

<p>Holy goodness, this answer is getting a lot of attention. (I'm not sure why -- I considered it to be just a ""fun"" little analogy, but whatever.)</p>

<p>I thought it might be germane to update this a bit with a few more technical thoughts.</p>

<p>Compilers are in the business of generating code which manages the storage of the data manipulated by that program. There are lots of different ways of generating code to manage memory, but over time two basic techniques have become entrenched. </p>

<p>The first is to have some sort of ""long lived"" storage area where the ""lifetime"" of each byte in the storage -- that is, the period of time when it is validly associated with some program variable -- cannot be easily predicted ahead of time. The compiler generates calls into a ""heap manager"" that knows how to dynamically allocate storage when it is needed and reclaim it when it is no longer needed.</p>

<p>The second method is to have a “short-lived” storage area where the lifetime of each byte is well known. Here, the lifetimes follow a “nesting” pattern. The longest-lived of these short-lived variables will be allocated before any other short-lived variables, and will be freed last. Shorter-lived variables will be allocated after the longest-lived ones, and will be freed before them. The lifetime of these shorter-lived variables is “nested” within the lifetime of longer-lived ones.</p>

<p>Local variables follow the latter pattern; when a method is entered, its local variables come alive. When that method calls another method, the new method's local variables come alive. They'll be dead before the first method's local variables are dead.  The relative order of the beginnings and endings of lifetimes of storages associated with local variables can be worked out ahead of time.</p>

<p>For this reason, local variables are usually generated as storage on a ""stack"" data structure, because a stack has the property that the first thing pushed on it is going to be the last thing popped off. </p>

<p>It's like the hotel decides to only rent out rooms sequentially, and you can't check out until everyone with a room number higher than you has checked out. </p>

<p>So let's think about the stack. In many operating systems you get one stack per thread and the stack is allocated to be a certain fixed size. When you call a method, stuff is pushed onto the stack. If you then pass a pointer to the stack back out of your method, as the original poster does here, that's just a pointer to the middle of some entirely valid million-byte memory block. In our analogy, you check out of the hotel; when you do, you just checked out of the highest-numbered occupied room.  If no one else checks in after you, and you go back to your room illegally, all your stuff is guaranteed to still be there <em>in this particular hotel</em>.</p>

<p>We use stacks for temporary stores because they are really cheap and easy. An implementation of C++ is not required to use a stack for storage of locals; it could use the heap. It doesn't, because that would make the program slower. </p>

<p>An implementation of C++ is not required to leave the garbage you left on the stack untouched so that you can come back for it later illegally; it is perfectly legal for the compiler to generate code that turns back to zero everything in the ""room"" that you just vacated. It doesn't because again, that would be expensive.</p>

<p>An implementation of C++ is not required to ensure that when the stack logically shrinks, the addresses that used to be valid are still mapped into memory. The implementation is allowed to tell the operating system ""we're done using this page of stack now. Until I say otherwise, issue an exception that destroys the process if anyone touches the previously-valid stack page"".  Again, implementations do not actually do that because it is slow and unnecessary.</p>

<p>Instead, implementations let you make mistakes and get away with it. Most of the time. Until one day something truly awful goes wrong and the process explodes.</p>

<p>This is problematic. There are a lot of rules and it is very easy to break them accidentally. I certainly have many times. And worse, the problem often only surfaces when memory is detected to be corrupt billions of nanoseconds after the corruption happened, when it is very hard to figure out who messed it up.</p>

<p>More memory-safe languages solve this problem by restricting your power. In ""normal"" C# there simply is no way to take the address of a local and return it or store it for later. You can take the address of a local, but the language is cleverly designed so that it is impossible to use it after the lifetime of the local ends. In order to take the address of a local and pass it back, you have to put the compiler in a special ""unsafe"" mode, <em>and</em> put the word ""unsafe"" in your program, to call attention to the fact that you are probably doing something dangerous that could be breaking the rules. </p>

<p>I've been following Stack Overflow literally from before its beginning (6-8 anyone?). Within the first year or so of its existence it became quite a major point of influence for me. I've learned and grown from it in my professional career enormously. And while I'm still learning from it, at some point my interaction with Stack Overflow tipped over into me ""putting in"" more than ""getting out"". I like the community, the site, the interaction model. It works. It accomplishes its design goal each and every day. My personal experience with it is all the proof I need for that.</p>

<p>Since my interaction with the community has become more and more meta over time, nominating myself for moderator seems like the logical next step. I'm often mostly curating the site with the few tools I have available anyway; if you think I'm doing a decent job at that and would be okay with giving me access to more tools, I'd be happy to wield them.</p>

<p>Some quick third-person facts about me:</p>

<ul>
<li>is mostly active in LAMP-stack related tags from PHP over Python, MySQL, Postgres, Javascript to AngularJS</li>
<li>has somehow managed to visit the site every day, even while his son was born</li>
<li>has problems with character limi</li>

<p>Just for the sake of completeness, here's a brain dump of related information...</p>
<p>As others have noted, <code>string</code> is an alias for <code>System.String</code>. Assuming your code using <code>String</code> compiles to <code>System.String</code> (i.e. you haven't got a using directive for some other namespace with a different <code>String</code> type), they compile to the same code, so at execution time there is no difference whatsoever. This is just one of the aliases in C#. The complete list is:</p>
<pre class=""lang-c# prettyprint-override""><code>object:  System.Object
string:  System.String
bool:    System.Boolean
byte:    System.Byte
sbyte:   System.SByte
short:   System.Int16
ushort:  System.UInt16
int:     System.Int32
uint:    System.UInt32
long:    System.Int64
ulong:   System.UInt64
float:   System.Single
double:  System.Double
decimal: System.Decimal
char:    System.Char
</code></pre>
<p>Apart from <code>string</code> and <code>object</code>, the aliases are all to value types. <code>decimal</code> is a value type, but not a primitive type in the CLR. The only primitive type which doesn't have an alias is <code>System.IntPtr</code>.</p>
<p>In the spec, the value type aliases are known as &quot;simple types&quot;. Literals can be used for constant values of every simple type; no other value types have literal forms available. (Compare this with VB, which allows <code>DateTime</code> literals, and has an alias for it too.)</p>
<p>There is one circumstance in which you <em>have</em> to use the aliases: when explicitly specifying an enum's underlying type. For instance:</p>
<pre class=""lang-c# prettyprint-override""><code>public enum Foo : UInt32 {} // Invalid
public enum Bar : uint   {} // Valid
</code></pre>
<p>That's just a matter of the way the spec defines enum declarations - the part after the colon has to be the <em>integral-type</em> production, which is one token of <code>sbyte</code>, <code>byte</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>ushort</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>uint</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>ulong</code>, <code>char</code>... as opposed to a <em>type</em> production as used by variable declarations for example. It doesn't indicate any other difference.</p>
<p>Finally, when it comes to which to use: personally I use the aliases everywhere for the implementation, but the CLR type for any APIs. It really doesn't matter too much which you use in terms of implementation - consistency among your team is nice, but no-one else is going to care. On the other hand, it's genuinely important that if you refer to a type in an API, you do so in a language-neutral way. A method called <code>ReadInt32</code> is unambiguous, whereas a method called <code>ReadInt</code> requires interpretation. The caller could be using a language that defines an <code>int</code> alias for <code>Int16</code>, for example. The .NET framework designers have followed this pattern, good examples being in the <code>BitConverter</code>, <code>BinaryReader</code> and <code>Convert</code> classes.</p>

<h2>Deleting a single array element</h2>
<p>If you want to delete just one array element you can use <a href=""https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.unset.php"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>unset()</code></a> or alternatively <a href=""https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.array-splice.php"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>\array_splice()</code></a>.</p>
<p>If you know the value and don’t know the key to delete the element you can use <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-search.php"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>\array_search()</code></a> to get the key. This only works if the element does not occur more than once, since <code>\array_search</code> returns the first hit only.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.unset.php"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>unset()</code></a></h3>
<p>Note that when you use <code>unset()</code> the array keys won’t change. If you want to reindex the keys you can use <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-values.php"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>\array_values()</code></a> after <code>unset()</code>, which will convert all keys to numerically enumerated keys starting from 0.</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<pre><code>$array = [0 =&gt; &quot;a&quot;, 1 =&gt; &quot;b&quot;, 2 =&gt; &quot;c&quot;];
unset($array[1]);
          // ↑ Key which you want to delete
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>[
    [0] =&gt; a
    [2] =&gt; c

<h3><a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-splice.php"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>\array_splice()</code></a> method</h3>
<p>If you use <code>\array_splice()</code> the keys will automatically be reindexed, but the associative keys won’t change — as opposed to <code>\array_values()</code>, which will convert all keys to numerical keys.</p>
<p><code>\array_splice()</code> needs the <em>offset</em>, not the <em>key</em>, as the second parameter.</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<pre><code>$array = [0 =&gt; &quot;a&quot;, 1 =&gt; &quot;b&quot;, 2 =&gt; &quot;c&quot;];
\array_splice($array, 1, 1);
                   // ↑ Offset which you want to delete
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>[
    [0] =&gt; a
    [1] =&gt; c
]
</code></pre>
<p><code>array_splice()</code>, same as <code>unset()</code>, take the array by reference. You don’t assign the return values of those functions back to the array.</p>
<h2>Deleting multiple array elements</h2>
<p>If you want to delete multiple array elements and don’t want to call <code>unset()</code> or <code>\array_splice()</code> multiple times you can use the functions <code>\array_diff()</code> or <code>\array_diff_key()</code> depending on whether you know the values or the keys of the elements which you want to delete.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-diff.php"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>\array_diff()</code></a> method</h3>
<p>If you know the values of the array elements which you want to delete, then you can use <code>\array_diff()</code>. As before with <code>unset()</code> it won’t change the keys of the array.</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<pre><code>$array = [0 =&gt; &quot;a&quot;, 1 =&gt; &quot;b&quot;, 2 =&gt; &quot;c&quot;, 3 =&gt; &quot;c&quot;];
$array = \array_diff($array, [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]);
                          // └────────┘
                          // Array values which you want to delete
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>[
    [1] =&gt; b
]
</code></pre>
<h3><a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-diff-key.php"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>\array_diff_key()</code></a> method</h3>
<p>If you know the keys of the elements which you want to delete, then you want to use <code>\array_diff_key()</code>. You have to make sure you pass the keys as keys in the second parameter and not as values. Keys won’t reindex.</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<pre><code>$array = [0 =&gt; &quot;a&quot;, 1 =&gt; &quot;b&quot;, 2 =&gt; &quot;c&quot;];
$array = \array_diff_key($array, [0 =&gt; &quot;xy&quot;, &quot;2&quot; =&gt; &quot;xy&quot;]);
                               // ↑           ↑
                               // Array keys which you want to delete
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>[
    [1] =&gt; b
]
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to use <code>unset()</code> or <code>\array_splice()</code> to delete multiple elements with the same value you can use <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-keys.php"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>\array_keys()</code></a> to get all the keys for a specific value and then delete all elements.</p>
<h3><a href=""https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-filter.php"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>\array_filter()</code></a> method</h3>
<p>If you want to delete all elements with a specific value in the array you can use <code>\array_filter()</code>.</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<pre><code>$array = [0 =&gt; &quot;a&quot;, 1 =&gt; &quot;b&quot;, 2 =&gt; &quot;c&quot;];
$array = \array_filter($array, static function ($element) {
    return $element !== &quot;b&quot;;
    //                   ↑
    // Array value which you want to delete

<p>For instance, to split on a period/dot <code>.</code> (which means &quot;<a href=""https://www.regular-expressions.info/dot.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">any character</a>&quot; in regex), use either <a href=""https://www.regular-expressions.info/characters.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">backslash <code>\</code></a> to escape the individual special character like so <code>split(&quot;\\.&quot;)</code>, or use <a href=""https://www.regular-expressions.info/charclass.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">character class <code>[]</code></a> to represent literal character(s) like so <code>split(&quot;[.]&quot;)</code>, or use <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#quote(java.lang.String)"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Pattern#quote()</code></a> to escape the entire string like so <code>split(Pattern.quote(&quot;.&quot;))</code>.</p>

<li><code>print</code>, <code>echo</code> and other functions producing output</li>
<li>Raw <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> sections prior <code>&lt;?php</code> code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why does it happen?</h2>
<p>To understand why headers must be sent before output it's necessary
to look at a typical <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol"" rel=""noreferrer"">HTTP</a>
response. PHP scripts mainly generate HTML content, but also pass a
set of HTTP/CGI headers to the webserver:</p>
<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Powered-By: PHP/5.3.7
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;PHP page output page&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Content&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some more output follows...&lt;/p&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=internal-icon-delayed&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The page/output always <em>follows</em> the headers. PHP has to pass the
headers to the webserver first. It can only do that once.
After the double linebreak it can nevermore amend them.</p>
<p>When PHP receives the first output (<code>print</code>, <code>echo</code>, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>) it will
<em>flush</em> all collected headers. Afterward it can send all the output
it wants. But sending further HTTP headers is impossible then.</p>
<h2>How can you find out where the premature output occurred?</h2>
<p>The <code>header()</code> warning contains all relevant information to
locate the problem cause:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by
<em><strong>(output started at</strong></em> /www/usr2345/htdocs/<b>auth.php:52</b>) in
/www/usr2345/htdocs/index.php on line 100</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here &quot;line 100&quot; refers to the script where the <code>header()</code> <em>invocation</em> failed.</p>
<p>The &quot;<em>output started at</em>&quot; note within the parenthesis is more significant.
It denominates the source of previous output. In this example, it's <code>auth.php</code>
and <strong>line <code>52</code></strong>. That's where you had to look for premature output.</p>
<p><em>Typical causes:</em></p>
<ol>
<li><h3>Print, echo</h3>
<p>Intentional output from <code>print</code> and <code>echo</code> statements will terminate the opportunity to send HTTP headers. The application flow must be restructured to avoid that. Use <a href=""http://php.net/function"" rel=""noreferrer"">functions</a>
and templating schemes. Ensure <code>header()</code> calls occur <em>before</em> messages
are written out.</p>
<p>Functions that produce output include</p>
<ul>
<li><code>print</code>, <code>echo</code>, <code>printf</code>, <code>vprintf</code></li>
<li><code>trigger_error</code>, <code>ob_flush</code>, <code>ob_end_flush</code>, <code>var_dump</code>, <code>print_r</code></li>
<li><code>readfile</code>, <code>passthru</code>, <code>flush</code>, <code>imagepng</code>, <code>imagejpeg</code></li>
</ul>
<p><br> among others and user-defined functions.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>Raw HTML areas</h3>
<p>Unparsed HTML sections in a <code>.php</code> file are direct output as well.
Script conditions that will trigger a <code>header()</code> call must be noted
before <em>any</em> raw <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> blocks.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;?php
    // Too late for headers already.
</code></pre>
<p>Use a templating scheme to separate processing from output logic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Place form processing code atop scripts.</li>
<li>Use temporary string variables to defer messages.</li>
<li>The actual output logic and intermixed HTML output should follow last.<br />
<br></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h3>Whitespace before <code>&lt;?php</code> for &quot;script.php <strong>line 1</strong>&quot; warnings</h3>
<p>If the warning refers to output inline <strong><code>1</code></strong>, then it's mostly
leading <strong>whitespace</strong>, text or HTML before the opening <code>&lt;?php</code> token.</p>
<pre><code> &lt;?php
# There's a SINGLE space/newline before &lt;? - Which already seals it.
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly it can occur for appended scripts or script sections:</p>
<pre><code>?&gt;

&lt;?php
</code></pre>
<p>PHP actually eats up a <em>single</em> linebreak after close tags. But it won't
compensate multiple newlines or tabs or spaces shifted into such gaps.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>UTF-8 BOM</h3>
<p>Linebreaks and spaces alone can be a problem. But there are also &quot;invisible&quot;
character sequences that can cause this. Most famously the
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>UTF-8 BOM</strong> (Byte-Order-Mark)</a>
which isn't displayed by most text editors. It's the byte sequence <code>EF BB BF</code>, which is optional and redundant for UTF-8 encoded documents. PHP however has to treat it as raw output. It may show up as the characters <code>ï»¿</code> in the output (if the client interprets the document as Latin-1) or similar &quot;garbage&quot;.</p>
<p>In particular graphical editors and Java-based IDEs are oblivious to its
presence. They don't visualize it (obliged by the Unicode standard).
Most programmer and console editors however do:</p>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aXgWY.png"" width=""590"" height=""140"" alt=""joes editor showing UTF-8 BOM placeholder, and MC editor a dot"">
<p>There it's easy to recognize the problem early on. Other editors may identify
its presence in a file/settings menu (Notepad++ on Windows can identify and
<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3589358/fix-utf8-bom"">remedy the problem</a>),
Another option to inspect the BOMs presence is resorting to an <strong>hexeditor</strong>.
On *nix systems <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/1/hexdump"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>hexdump</code></a> is usually available,
if not a graphical variant which simplifies auditing these and other issues:</p>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QyqUr.png"" width=""560"" height=""87"" alt=""beav hexeditor showing utf-8 bom"">
<p>An easy fix is to set the text editor to save files as &quot;UTF-8 (no BOM)&quot;
or similar to such nomenclature. Often newcomers otherwise resort to creating new files and just copy&amp;pasting the previous code back in.</p>
<h3>Correction utilities <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wnAS9.gif"" width=""30"" height=""20""></h3>
<p>There are also automated tools to examine and rewrite text files
(<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1068650/using-awk-to-remove-the-byte-order-mark""><code>sed</code>/<code>awk</code></a> or <code>recode</code>).
For PHP specifically there's the <a href=""http://freshcode.club/projects/phptags"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>phptags</code> tag tidier</a>.
It rewrites close and open tags into long and short forms, but also easily
fixes leading and trailing whitespace, Unicode and UTF-x BOM issues:</p>
<pre><code>phptags  --whitespace  *.php
</code></pre>
<p>It's safe to use on a whole include or project directory.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>Whitespace after <code>?&gt;</code></h3>
<p>If the error source is mentioned as behind the
<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4410704/php-closing-tag"">closing <code>?&gt;</code></a>
then this is where some whitespace or the raw text got written out.
The PHP end marker does not terminate script execution at this point. Any text/space characters after it will be written out as page content
still.</p>
<p>It's commonly advised, in particular to newcomers, that trailing <code>?&gt;</code> PHP
close tags should be omitted. This <em>eschews</em> a small portion of these cases.
(Quite commonly <code>include()d</code> scripts are the culprit.)</p>
</li>
<li><h3>Error source mentioned as &quot;Unknown on line 0&quot;</h3>
<p>It's typically a PHP extension or php.ini setting if no error source
is concretized.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's occasionally the <code>gzip</code> stream encoding setting
<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/622192/php-warning-headers-already-sent-in-unknown"">or the <code>ob_gzhandler</code></a>.</li>
<li>But it could also be any doubly loaded <code>extension=</code> module
generating an implicit PHP startup/warning message.<br />
<br></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h3>Preceding error messages</h3>
<p>If another PHP statement or expression causes a warning message or
notice being printed out, that also counts as premature output.</p>
<p>In this case you need to eschew the error,
delay the statement execution, or suppress the message with e.g.
<a href=""http://php.net/isset"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>isset()</code></a> or <a href=""http://php.net/@"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>@()</code></a> -
when either doesn't obstruct debugging later on.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>No error message</h2>
<p>If you have <code>error_reporting</code> or <code>display_errors</code> disabled per <code>php.ini</code>,
then no warning will show up. But ignoring errors won't make the problem go
away. Headers still can't be sent after premature output.</p>
<p>So when <code>header(&quot;Location: ...&quot;)</code> redirects silently fail it's very
advisable to probe for warnings. Reenable them with two simple commands
atop the invocation script:</p>
<pre><code>error_reporting(E_ALL);
ini_set(&quot;display_errors&quot;, 1);
</code></pre>
<p>Or <code>set_error_handler(&quot;var_dump&quot;);</code> if all else fails.</p>
<p>Speaking of redirect headers, you should often use an idiom like
this for final code paths:</p>
<pre><code>exit(header(&quot;Location: /finished.html&quot;));
</code></pre>
<p>Preferably even a utility function, which prints a user message
in case of <code>header()</code> failures.</p>
<h2>Output buffering as a workaround</h2>
<p>PHPs <a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.outcontrol.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">output buffering</a>
is a workaround to alleviate this issue. It often works reliably, but shouldn't
substitute for proper application structuring and separating output from control
logic. Its actual purpose is minimizing chunked transfers to the webserver.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/outcontrol.configuration.php"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>output_buffering=</code></a>
setting nevertheless can help.
Configure it in the <a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.file.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">php.ini</a>
or via <a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.changes.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">.htaccess</a>
or even <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/configuration.file.per-user.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">.user.ini</a> on
modern FPM/FastCGI setups.<br />
Enabling it will allow PHP to buffer output instead of passing it to the webserver instantly. PHP thus can aggregate HTTP headers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It can likewise be engaged with a call to <a href=""http://php.net/ob_start"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ob_start();</code></a>
atop the invocation script. Which however is less reliable for multiple reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Even if <code>&lt;?php ob_start(); ?&gt;</code> starts the first script, whitespace or a
BOM might get shuffled before, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2168956/php-header-problem-even-i-use-ob-start-and-ob-end-flush"">rendering it ineffective</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It can conceal whitespace for HTML output. But as soon as the application logic attempts to send binary content (a generated image for example),
the buffered extraneous output becomes a problem. (Necessitating <code>ob_clean()</code>
as a further workaround.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The buffer is limited in size, and can easily overrun when left to defaults.
And that's not a rare occurrence either, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17643837/php-headers-already-sent-error-depending-on-output-length"">difficult to track down</a>
when it happens.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Both approaches therefore may become unreliable - in particular when switching between
development setups and/or production servers. This is why output buffering is
widely considered just a crutch / strictly a workaround.</p>

has changed. It's likely unconfigured on the current/new server.</p>
<h2>Checking with <code>headers_sent()</code></h2>
<p>You can always use <a href=""http://php.net/headers_sent"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>headers_sent()</code></a> to probe if
it's still possible to... send headers. Which is useful to conditionally print
info or apply other fallback logic.</p>
<pre><code>if (headers_sent()) {
    die(&quot;Redirect failed. Please click on this link: &lt;a href=...&gt;&quot;);
}
else{
    exit(header(&quot;Location: /user.php&quot;));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Useful fallback workarounds are:</p>
<ul>
<li><h3>HTML <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag</h3>
<p>If your application is structurally hard to fix, then an easy (but
somewhat unprofessional) way to allow redirects is injecting a HTML
<code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag. A redirect can be achieved with:</p>
<pre><code> &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Location&quot; content=&quot;http://example.com/&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Or with a short delay:</p>
<pre><code> &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Refresh&quot; content=&quot;2; url=../target.html&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This leads to non-valid HTML when utilized past the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section.
Most browsers still accept it.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>JavaScript redirect</h3>
<p>As alternative a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/503093/how-can-i-make-a-redirect-page-in-jquery-javascript"">JavaScript redirect</a>
can be used for page redirects:</p>
<pre><code> &lt;script&gt; location.replace(&quot;target.html&quot;); &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>While this is often more HTML compliant than the <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> workaround,
it incurs a reliance on JavaScript-capable clients.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both approaches however make acceptable fallbacks when genuine HTTP header()
calls fail. Ideally you'd always combine this with a user-friendly message and
clickable link as last resort. (Which for instance is what the <a href=""https://php.uz/manual/en/function.http-redirect.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">http_redirect()</a>
PECL extension does.)</p>
<h2>Why <code>setcookie()</code> and <code>session_start()</code> are also affected</h2>
<p>Both <code>setcookie()</code> and <code>session_start()</code> need to send a <code>Set-Cookie:</code> HTTP header.
The same conditions therefore apply, and similar error messages will be generated
for premature output situations.</p>
<p>(Of course, they're furthermore affected by disabled cookies in the browser
or even proxy issues. The session functionality obviously also depends on free
disk space and other php.ini settings, etc.)</p>

<h2>In response to the OP's question:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>What are the correct version numbers for C#? What came out when? Why can't I find any answers about C# 3.5?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no such thing as C# 3.5 - the cause of confusion here is that the C# 3.0 is present in .NET 3.5. The language and framework are versioned independently, however - as is the CLR, which is at version 2.0 for .NET 2.0 through 3.5, .NET 4 introducing CLR 4.0, service packs notwithstanding. The CLR in .NET 4.5 has various improvements, but the versioning is unclear: in some places it may be referred to as CLR 4.5 (<a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb822049.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this MSDN page</a> used to refer to it that way, for example), but the <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.environment.version"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>Environment.Version</code></a> property still reports 4.0.xxx.</p>
<p>As of May 3, 2017, the C# Language Team created a history of C# versions and features on their GitHub repository: <a href=""https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/Language-Version-History.md"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Features Added in C# Language Versions</a>. There is also <a href=""https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/docs/Language%20Feature%20Status.md"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a page that tracks upcoming and recently implemented language features</a>.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import string
&gt;&gt;&gt; import random
&gt;&gt;&gt; def id_generator(size=6, chars=string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits):
...    return ''.join(random.choice(chars) for _ in range(size))
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; id_generator()
'G5G74W'
&gt;&gt;&gt; id_generator(3, &quot;6793YUIO&quot;)
'Y3U'
</code></pre>
<p><strong>How does it work ?</strong></p>
<p>We import <code>string</code>, a module that contains sequences of common ASCII characters, and <code>random</code>, a module that deals with random generation.</p>
<p><code>string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits</code> just concatenates the list of characters representing uppercase ASCII chars and digits:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; string.ascii_uppercase
'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
&gt;&gt;&gt; string.digits
'0123456789'
&gt;&gt;&gt; string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits
'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789'
</code></pre>
<p>Then we use a list comprehension to create a list of 'n' elements:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; range(4) # range create a list of 'n' numbers
[0, 1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; ['elem' for _ in range(4)] # we use range to create 4 times 'elem'
['elem', 'elem', 'elem', 'elem']
</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, we use <code>[</code> to create the list, but we don't in the <code>id_generator</code> function so Python doesn't create the list in memory, but generates the elements on the fly, one by one (more about this <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/231767/the-python-yield-keyword-explained/231855#231855"">here</a>).</p>
<p>Instead of asking to create 'n' times the string <code>elem</code>, we will ask Python to create 'n' times a random character, picked from a sequence of characters:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; random.choice(&quot;abcde&quot;)
'a'
&gt;&gt;&gt; random.choice(&quot;abcde&quot;)
'd'
&gt;&gt;&gt; random.choice(&quot;abcde&quot;)
'b'
</code></pre>
<p>Therefore <code>random.choice(chars) for _ in range(size)</code> really is creating a sequence of <code>size</code> characters. Characters that are randomly picked from <code>chars</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [random.choice('abcde') for _ in range(3)]
['a', 'b', 'b']
&gt;&gt;&gt; [random.choice('abcde') for _ in range(3)]
['e', 'b', 'e']
&gt;&gt;&gt; [random.choice('abcde') for _ in range(3)]
['d', 'a', 'c']
</code></pre>
<p>Then we just join them with an empty string so the sequence becomes a string:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; ''.join(['a', 'b', 'b'])
'abb'
&gt;&gt;&gt; [random.choice('abcde') for _ in range(3)]
['d', 'c', 'b']
&gt;&gt;&gt; ''.join(random.choice('abcde') for _ in range(3))
'dac'

<p>You can do that using <code>git stash --patch</code> (or <code>git stash -p</code>) -- you'll enter interactive mode where you'll be presented with each hunk that was changed. Use <code>n</code> to skip the files that you don't want to stash, <code>y</code> when you encounter the one that you want to stash, and <code>q</code> to quit and leave the remaining hunks unstashed.  <code>a</code> will stash the shown hunk and the rest of the hunks in that file.</p>

<p>The correct minimum set of headers that works across all mentioned clients (and proxies):</p>
<pre><code>Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache

</code></pre>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Cache-Control</code></a> is per the HTTP 1.1 spec for clients and proxies (and implicitly required by some clients next to <code>Expires</code>). The <a href=""http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.32"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Pragma</code></a> is per the HTTP 1.0 spec for prehistoric clients. The <a href=""http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.21"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Expires</code></a> is per the HTTP 1.0 and 1.1 specs for clients and proxies. In HTTP 1.1, the <code>Cache-Control</code> takes precedence over <code>Expires</code>, so it's after all for HTTP 1.0 proxies only.</p>
<p>If you don't care about IE6 and its broken caching when serving pages over HTTPS with only <code>no-store</code>, then you could omit <code>Cache-Control: no-cache</code>.</p>
<pre><code>Cache-Control: no-store, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: 0
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't care about IE6 nor HTTP 1.0 clients (HTTP 1.1 was introduced in 1997), then you could omit <code>Pragma</code>.</p>
<pre><code>Cache-Control: no-store, must-revalidate
Expires: 0
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't care about HTTP 1.0 proxies either, then you could omit <code>Expires</code>.</p>
<pre><code>Cache-Control: no-store, must-revalidate
</code></pre>
<p>On the other hand, if the server auto-includes a valid <code>Date</code> header, then you could theoretically omit <code>Cache-Control</code> too and rely on <code>Expires</code> only.</p>
<pre><code>Date: Wed, 24 Aug 2016 18:32:02 GMT
Expires: 0
</code></pre>
<p>But that may fail if e.g. the end-user manipulates the operating system date and the client software is relying on it.</p>

<h1>HTML meta tags vs HTTP response headers</h1>
<p>Important to know is that when an HTML page is served over an HTTP connection, and a header is present in <strong>both</strong> the HTTP response headers and the HTML <code>&lt;meta http-equiv&gt;</code> tags, then the one specified in the HTTP response header will get precedence over the HTML meta tag. The HTML meta tag will only be used when the page is viewed from a local disk file system via a <code>file://</code> URL. See also <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/charset.html#h-5.2.2"" rel=""noreferrer"">W3 HTML spec chapter 5.2.2</a>. Take care with this when you don't specify them programmatically because the webserver can namely include some default values.</p>
<p>Generally, you'd better just <strong>not</strong> specify the HTML meta tags to avoid confusion by starters and rely on hard HTTP response headers. Moreover, specifically those <code>&lt;meta http-equiv&gt;</code> tags are <a href=""http://validator.w3.org"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>invalid</strong></a> in HTML5. Only the <code>http-equiv</code> values listed in <a href=""http://w3c.github.io/html/document-metadata.html#pragma-directives"" rel=""noreferrer"">HTML5 specification</a> are allowed.</p>
<h1>Verifying the actual HTTP response headers</h1>
<p>To verify the one and the other, you can see/debug them in the HTTP traffic monitor of the web browser's developer toolset. You can get there by pressing F12 in Chrome/Firefox23+/IE9+, and then opening the &quot;Network&quot; or &quot;Net&quot; tab panel, and then clicking the HTTP request of interest to uncover all detail about the HTTP request and response. The <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fSnXH.png"" rel=""noreferrer"">below screenshot</a> is from Chrome:</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fSnXH.png"" alt=""Chrome developer toolset HTTP traffic monitor showing HTTP response headers on stackoverflow.com"" /></p>
<h1>I want to set those headers on file downloads too</h1>
<p>First of all, this question and answer are targeted on &quot;web pages&quot; (HTML pages), not &quot;file downloads&quot; (PDF, zip, Excel, etc). You'd better have them cached and make use of some file version identifier somewhere in the URI path or query string to force a redownload on a changed file. When applying those no-cache headers on file downloads anyway, then beware of the IE7/8 bug when serving a file download over HTTPS instead of HTTP. For detail, see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/5034454"">IE cannot download foo.jsf. IE was not able to open this internet site. The requested site is either unavailable or cannot be found</a>.</p>

All it contains is your start, stop and step values, then as you iterate over the object the next integer is calculated each iteration.</p>
<p>The object also implements the <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__contains__"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>object.__contains__</code> hook</a>, and <em>calculates</em> if your number is part of its range. Calculating is a (near) constant time operation <sup>*</sup>. There is never a need to scan through all possible integers in the range.</p>
<p>From the <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#range"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>range()</code> object documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The advantage of the <code>range</code> type over a regular <code>list</code> or <code>tuple</code> is that a range object will always take the same (small) amount of memory, no matter the size of the range it represents (as it only stores the <code>start</code>, <code>stop</code> and <code>step</code> values, calculating individual items and subranges as needed).</p>

<p>This is still missing several things that a real <code>range()</code> supports (such as the <code>.index()</code> or <code>.count()</code> methods, hashing, equality testing, or slicing), but should give you an idea.</p>
<p>I also simplified the <code>__contains__</code> implementation to only focus on integer tests; if you give a real <code>range()</code> object a non-integer value (including subclasses of <code>int</code>), a slow scan is initiated to see if there is a match, just as if you use a containment test against a list of all the contained values. This was done to continue to support other numeric types that just happen to support equality testing with integers but are not expected to support integer arithmetic as well. See the original <a href=""http://bugs.python.org/issue1766304"" rel=""noreferrer"">Python issue</a> that implemented the containment test.</p>
<hr />
<p>* <em>Near</em> constant time because Python integers are unbounded and so math operations also grow in time as N grows, making this a O(log N) operation. Since it’s all executed in optimised C code and Python stores integer values in 30-bit chunks, you’d run out of memory before you saw any performance impact due to the size of the integers involved here.</p>

<h3>Maintaining the session</h3>
<p>The server side session is usually backed by a cookie. Some web forms require that you're logged in and/or are tracked by a session. You can use the <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/CookieHandler.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>CookieHandler</code></a> API to maintain cookies. You need to prepare a <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/CookieManager.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>CookieManager</code></a> with a <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/CookiePolicy.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>CookiePolicy</code></a> of <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/CookiePolicy.html#ACCEPT_ALL"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ACCEPT_ALL</code></a> before sending all HTTP requests.</p>
<pre><code>// First set the default cookie manager.
CookieHandler.setDefault(new CookieManager(null, CookiePolicy.ACCEPT_ALL));

// All the following subsequent URLConnections will use the same cookie manager.
URLConnection connection = new URL(url).openConnection();
// ...

connection = new URL(url).openConnection();
// ...

connection = new URL(url).openConnection();
// ...
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this is known to not always work properly in all circumstances. If it fails for you, then best is to manually gather and set the cookie headers. You basically need to grab all <code>Set-Cookie</code> headers from the response of the login or the first <code>GET</code> request and then pass this through the subsequent requests.</p>
<pre><code>// Gather all cookies on the first request.
URLConnection connection = new URL(url).openConnection();
List&lt;String&gt; cookies = connection.getHeaderFields().get(&quot;Set-Cookie&quot;);
// ...

// Then use the same cookies on all subsequent requests.
connection = new URL(url).openConnection();
for (String cookie : cookies) {
    connection.addRequestProperty(&quot;Cookie&quot;, cookie.split(&quot;;&quot;, 2)[0]);
}
// ...
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>split(&quot;;&quot;, 2)[0]</code> is there to get rid of cookie attributes which are irrelevant for the server side like <code>expires</code>, <code>path</code>, etc. Alternatively, you could also use <code>cookie.substring(0, cookie.indexOf(';'))</code> instead of <code>split()</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Streaming mode</h3>
<p>The <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/HttpURLConnection.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>HttpURLConnection</code></a> will by default buffer the <em>entire</em> request body before actually sending it, regardless of whether you've set a fixed content length yourself using <code>connection.setRequestProperty(&quot;Content-Length&quot;, contentLength);</code>. This may cause <code>OutOfMemoryException</code>s whenever you concurrently send large POST requests (e.g. uploading files). To avoid this, you would like to set the <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/HttpURLConnection.html#setFixedLengthStreamingMode%28int%29"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>HttpURLConnection#setFixedLengthStreamingMode()</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code>httpConnection.setFixedLengthStreamingMode(contentLength);
</code></pre>
<p>But if the content length is really not known beforehand, then you can make use of chunked streaming mode by setting the <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/HttpURLConnection.html#setChunkedStreamingMode%28int%29"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>HttpURLConnection#setChunkedStreamingMode()</code></a> accordingly. This will set the HTTP <a href=""http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.41"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Transfer-Encoding</code></a> header to <code>chunked</code> which will force the request body being sent in chunks. The below example will send the body in chunks of 1 KB.</p>
<pre><code>httpConnection.setChunkedStreamingMode(1024);
</code></pre>
<hr />
<h3>User-Agent</h3>
<p>It can happen that <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13670692/403-forbidden-with-java-but-not-web-browser"">a request returns an unexpected response, while it works fine with a real web browser</a>. The server side is probably blocking requests based on the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.43"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>User-Agent</code></a> request header. The <code>URLConnection</code> will by default set it to <code>Java/1.6.0_19</code> where the last part is obviously the JRE version. You can override this as follows:</p>
<pre><code>connection.setRequestProperty(&quot;User-Agent&quot;, &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.36&quot;); // Do as if you're using Chrome 41 on Windows 7.
</code></pre>
<p>Use the User-Agent string from a <a href=""http://www.useragentstring.com/pages/useragentstring.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">recent browser</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Error handling</h3>
<p>If the HTTP response code is <code>4nn</code> (Client Error) or <code>5nn</code> (Server Error), then you may want to read the <code>HttpURLConnection#getErrorStream()</code> to see if the server has sent any useful error information.</p>
<pre><code>InputStream error = ((HttpURLConnection) connection).getErrorStream();
</code></pre>
<p>If the HTTP response code is -1, then something went wrong with connection and response handling. The <code>HttpURLConnection</code> implementation is in older JREs somewhat buggy with keeping connections alive. You may want to turn it off by setting the <code>http.keepAlive</code> system property to <code>false</code>. You can do this programmatically in the beginning of your application by:</p>
<pre><code>System.setProperty(&quot;http.keepAlive&quot;, &quot;false&quot;);
</code></pre>
<hr />
<h3>Uploading files</h3>
<p>You'd normally use <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.2"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>multipart/form-data</code></a> encoding for mixed POST content (binary and character data). The encoding is in more detail described in <a href=""http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2388.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">RFC2388</a>.</p>
<pre><code>String param = &quot;value&quot;;
File textFile = new File(&quot;/path/to/file.txt&quot;);
File binaryFile = new File(&quot;/path/to/file.bin&quot;);
String boundary = Long.toHexString(System.currentTimeMillis()); // Just generate some unique random value.
String CRLF = &quot;\r\n&quot;; // Line separator required by multipart/form-data.
URLConnection connection = new URL(url).openConnection();
connection.setDoOutput(true);
connection.setRequestProperty(&quot;Content-Type&quot;, &quot;multipart/form-data; boundary=&quot; + boundary);

try (
    OutputStream output = connection.getOutputStream();
    PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(output, charset), true);
) {
    // Send normal param.
    writer.append(&quot;--&quot; + boundary).append(CRLF);
    writer.append(&quot;Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\&quot;param\&quot;&quot;).append(CRLF);
    writer.append(&quot;Content-Type: text/plain; charset=&quot; + charset).append(CRLF);
    writer.append(CRLF).append(param).append(CRLF).flush();

    // Send text file.

    writer.append(&quot;Content-Type: text/plain; charset=&quot; + charset).append(CRLF); // Text file itself must be saved in this charset!
    writer.append(CRLF).flush();
    Files.copy(textFile.toPath(), output);
    output.flush(); // Important before continuing with writer!
    writer.append(CRLF).flush(); // CRLF is important! It indicates end of boundary.

    // Send binary file.
    writer.append(&quot;--&quot; + boundary).append(CRLF);
    writer.append(&quot;Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\&quot;binaryFile\&quot;; filename=\&quot;&quot; + binaryFile.getName() + &quot;\&quot;&quot;).append(CRLF);
    writer.append(&quot;Content-Type: &quot; + URLConnection.guessContentTypeFromName(binaryFile.getName())).append(CRLF);
    writer.append(&quot;Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary&quot;).append(CRLF);
    writer.append(CRLF).flush();
    Files.copy(binaryFile.toPath(), output);
    output.flush(); // Important before continuing with writer!
    writer.append(CRLF).flush(); // CRLF is important! It indicates end of boundary.

    // End of multipart/form-data.
    writer.append(&quot;--&quot; + boundary + &quot;--&quot;).append(CRLF).flush();
}

<p>If the other side is an <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServlet.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>HttpServlet</code></a>, then its <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServlet.html#doPost%28javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest,%20javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse%29"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>doPost()</code></a> method will be called and the parts will be available by <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html#getPart%28java.lang.String%29"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>HttpServletRequest#getPart()</code></a> (note, thus <strong>not</strong> <code>getParameter()</code> and so on!). The <code>getPart()</code> method is however relatively new, it's introduced in Servlet 3.0 (Glassfish 3, Tomcat 7, etc.). Prior to Servlet 3.0, your best choice is using <a href=""http://commons.apache.org/fileupload"" rel=""noreferrer"">Apache Commons FileUpload</a> to parse a <code>multipart/form-data</code> request. Also see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2422468/upload-big-file-to-servlet/2424824#2424824"">this answer</a> for examples of both the FileUpload and the Servelt 3.0 approaches.</p>

<h3>Dealing with untrusted or misconfigured HTTPS sites</h3>
<p><sup><em>In case you're developing for Android instead of Java, <strong>be careful</strong>: the workaround below may save your day if you don't have correct certificates deployed during development. But you should not use it for production. These days (April 2021) Google will not allow your app be distributed on Play Store if they detect insecure hostname verifier, see <a href=""https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7188426."" rel=""noreferrer"">https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7188426.</a></em></sup></p>
<p>Sometimes you need to connect an HTTPS URL, perhaps because you're writing a web scraper. In that case, you may likely face a <code>javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Not trusted server certificate</code> on some HTTPS sites who doesn't keep their SSL certificates up to date, or a <code>java.security.cert.CertificateException: No subject alternative DNS name matching [hostname] found</code> or <code>javax.net.ssl.SSLProtocolException: handshake alert: unrecognized_name</code> on some misconfigured HTTPS sites.</p>
<p>The following one-time-run <code>static</code> initializer in your web scraper class should make <code>HttpsURLConnection</code> more lenient as to those HTTPS sites and thus not throw those exceptions anymore.</p>
<pre><code>static {
    TrustManager[] trustAllCertificates = new TrustManager[] {
        new X509TrustManager() {
            @Override
            public X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers() {
                return null; // Not relevant.
            }
            @Override
            public void checkClientTrusted(X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) {
                // Do nothing. Just allow them all.
            }
            @Override
            public void checkServerTrusted(X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) {
                // Do nothing. Just allow them all.
            }
        }
    };

    HostnameVerifier trustAllHostnames = new HostnameVerifier() {
        @Override
        public boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session) {
            return true; // Just allow them all.
        }
    };

    try {

<p><strong>Brief Intro</strong></p>

<p>My name is Siddharth Rout &amp; I would like to nominate myself.</p>

<p>Stack Overflow is always open with 2 other sites on my firefox tabs. If I am not answering new questions, I would probably be visiting old questions/comments &amp; answering/editing/retagging/flagging them or clearing the queues.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Reasons Why I feel that I can be a Stack Overflow mod</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>I'm already a mod in vbforums &amp; msdn. So the concept of moderation isn't new to me &amp; I come with relevant expertise which is required for moderation</li>
<li>I work from home so I've enough time on my hands to devote to moderation. Especially on weekends. (TimeZone: UTC + 05:30)</li>
<li>I'm very friendly, approachable &amp; a fast learner besides being a good team player.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p><strong>What would be my main focus if I become a mod</strong></p>

<p>My main focus will <strong>NOT</strong> be to clear the mod queues or perform a specific mod duty like opening/closing questions etc. These duties come ""<strong>As Is</strong>"" when one becomes a mod &amp; one has to do them.</p>

<p>My <strong>special agenda</strong> would be to make Stack Overflow a more welcoming place for new users. I believe if all of us actually put in special efforts to do this then the flags will automatically reduce drastically.</p>

    &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Go to Google&quot; /&gt;

<ul>
<li>avoiding to answer unclear/too broad questions, closing instead</li>
<li>being a FFGITW to find the best duplicate when I can hammer before dupe answers pour in.</li>

A RIGHT JOIN B           A RIGHT OUTER JOIN B
A FULL JOIN B            A FULL OUTER JOIN B
A INNER JOIN B           A JOIN B

<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
<p>You are trying to use something that is <code>null</code> (or <code>Nothing</code> in VB.NET). This means you either set it to <code>null</code>, or you never set it to anything at all.</p>
<p>Like anything else, <code>null</code> gets passed around. If it is <code>null</code> <em>in</em> method &quot;A&quot;, it could be that method &quot;B&quot; passed a <code>null</code> <em>to</em> method &quot;A&quot;.</p>
<p><code>null</code> can have different meanings:</p>
<ol>
<li>Object variables that are <strong>uninitialized</strong> and hence <strong>point to nothing.</strong> In this case, if you access members of such objects, it causes a <code>NullReferenceException</code>.</li>
<li>The developer is <strong>using <code>null</code> intentionally to indicate there is no meaningful value available.</strong> Note that C# has the concept of nullable datatypes for variables (like database tables can have nullable fields) - you can assign <code>null</code> to them to indicate there is no value stored in it, for example <code>int? a = null;</code> (which is a shortcut for <code>Nullable&lt;int&gt; a = null;</code>) where the question mark indicates it is allowed to store <code>null</code> in variable <code>a</code>. You can check that either with <code>if (a.HasValue) {...}</code> or with <code>if (a==null) {...}</code>. Nullable variables, like <code>a</code> this example, allow to access the value via <code>a.Value</code> explicitly, or just as normal via <code>a</code>. <br/><strong>Note</strong> that accessing it via <code>a.Value</code> throws an <code>InvalidOperationException</code> instead of a <code>NullReferenceException</code> if <code>a</code> is <code>null</code> - you should do the check beforehand, i.e. if you have another non-nullable variable <code>int b;</code> then you should do assignments like <code>if (a.HasValue) { b = a.Value; }</code> or shorter <code>if (a != null) { b = a; }</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rest of this article goes into more detail and shows mistakes that many programmers often make which can lead to a <code>NullReferenceException</code>.</p>
<h2>More Specifically</h2>
<p>The <code>runtime</code> throwing a <code>NullReferenceException</code> <strong>always</strong> means the same thing: you are trying to use a reference, and the reference is not initialized (or it was <em>once</em> initialized, but is <em>no longer</em> initialized).</p>
<p>This means the reference is <code>null</code>, and you cannot access members (such as methods) through a <code>null</code> reference. The simplest case:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>string foo = null;
foo.ToUpper();
</code></pre>
<p>This will throw a <code>NullReferenceException</code> at the second line because you can't call the instance method <code>ToUpper()</code> on a <code>string</code> reference pointing to <code>null</code>.</p>
<h1>Debugging</h1>
<p>How do you find the source of a <code>NullReferenceException</code>? Apart from looking at the exception itself, which will be thrown exactly at the location where it occurs, the general rules of debugging in Visual Studio apply: place strategic breakpoints and <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/debugger-windows"" rel=""noreferrer"">inspect your variables</a>, either by hovering the mouse over their names, opening a (Quick)Watch window or using the various debugging panels like Locals and Autos.</p>
<p>If you want to find out where the reference is or isn't set, right-click its name and select &quot;Find All References&quot;. You can then place a breakpoint at every found location and run your program with the debugger attached. Every time the debugger breaks on such a breakpoint, you need to determine whether you expect the reference to be non-null, inspect the variable, and verify that it points to an instance when you expect it to.</p>
<p>By following the program flow this way, you can find the location where the instance should not be null, and why it isn't properly set.</p>
<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>Some common scenarios where the exception can be thrown:</p>
<h3>Generic</h3>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>ref1.ref2.ref3.member
</code></pre>
<p>If ref1 or ref2 or ref3 is null, then you'll get a <code>NullReferenceException</code>. If you want to solve the problem, then find out which one is null by rewriting the expression to its simpler equivalent:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>var r1 = ref1;
var r2 = r1.ref2;
var r3 = r2.ref3;
r3.member
</code></pre>
<p>Specifically, in <code>HttpContext.Current.User.Identity.Name</code>, the <code>HttpContext.Current</code> could be null, or the <code>User</code> property could be null, or the <code>Identity</code> property could be null.</p>
<h3>Indirect</h3>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>public class Person 
{
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
public class Book 
{
    public Person Author { get; set; }
}
public class Example 
{
    public void Foo() 
    {
        Book b1 = new Book();
        int authorAge = b1.Author.Age; // You never initialized the Author property.
                                       // there is no Person to get an Age from.
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to avoid the child (Person) null reference, you could initialize it in the parent (Book) object's constructor.</p>
<h3>Nested Object Initializers</h3>
<p>The same applies to nested object initializers:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>Book b1 = new Book 
{ 
   Author = { Age = 45 } 
};
</code></pre>
<p>This translates to:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>Book b1 = new Book();
b1.Author.Age = 45;
</code></pre>
<p>While the <code>new</code> keyword is used, it only creates a new instance of <code>Book</code>, but not a new instance of <code>Person</code>, so the <code>Author</code> the property is still <code>null</code>.</p>
<h3>Nested Collection Initializers</h3>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>public class Person 
{
    public ICollection&lt;Book&gt; Books { get; set; }
}
public class Book 
{
    public string Title { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The nested collection <code>Initializers</code> behave the same:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>Person p1 = new Person 
{
    Books = {
         new Book { Title = &quot;Title1&quot; },
         new Book { Title = &quot;Title2&quot; },
    }
};
</code></pre>
<p>This translates to:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>Person p1 = new Person();
p1.Books.Add(new Book { Title = &quot;Title1&quot; });
p1.Books.Add(new Book { Title = &quot;Title2&quot; });
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>new Person</code> only creates an instance of <code>Person</code>, but the <code>Books</code> collection is still <code>null</code>. The collection <code>Initializer</code> syntax does not create a collection
for <code>p1.Books</code>, it only translates to the <code>p1.Books.Add(...)</code> statements.</p>
<h3>Array</h3>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>int[] numbers = null;
int n = numbers[0]; // numbers is null. There is no array to index.
</code></pre>
<h3>Array Elements</h3>
<pre><code>Person[] people = new Person[5];
people[0].Age = 20 // people[0] is null. The array was allocated but not
                   // initialized. There is no Person to set the Age for.
</code></pre>
<h3>Jagged Arrays</h3>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>long[][] array = new long[1][];
array[0][0] = 3; // is null because only the first dimension is yet initialized.
                 // Use array[0] = new long[2]; first.
</code></pre>
<h3>Collection/List/Dictionary</h3>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt; agesForNames = null;
int age = agesForNames[&quot;Bob&quot;]; // agesForNames is null.
                               // There is no Dictionary to perform the lookup.
</code></pre>
<h3>Range Variable (Indirect/Deferred)</h3>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>public class Person 
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
var people = new List&lt;Person&gt;();
people.Add(null);
var names = from p in people select p.Name;
string firstName = names.First(); // Exception is thrown here, but actually occurs
                                  // on the line above.  &quot;p&quot; is null because the
                                  // first element we added to the list is null.
</code></pre>
<h3>Events (C#)</h3>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>public class Demo
{
    public event EventHandler StateChanged;
    
    protected virtual void OnStateChanged(EventArgs e)
    {        
        StateChanged(this, e); // Exception is thrown here 
                               // if no event handlers have been attached
                               // to StateChanged event
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>(Note: The VB.NET compiler inserts null checks for event usage, so it's not necessary to check events for <code>Nothing</code> in VB.NET.)</p>
<h3>Bad Naming Conventions:</h3>
<p>If you named fields differently from locals, you might have realized that you never initialized the field.</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>public class Form1
{
    private Customer customer;
    
    private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) 
    {
        Customer customer = new Customer();
        customer.Name = &quot;John&quot;;
    }
    
    private void Button_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        MessageBox.Show(customer.Name);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This can be solved by following the convention to prefix fields with an underscore:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>    private Customer _customer;
</code></pre>
<h3>ASP.NET Page Life cycle:</h3>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>public partial class Issues_Edit : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    protected TestIssue myIssue;

    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        if (!IsPostBack)
        {
             // Only called on first load, not when button clicked
             myIssue = new TestIssue(); 
        }
    }
        
    protected void SaveButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        myIssue.Entry = &quot;NullReferenceException here!&quot;;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>ASP.NET Session Values</h3>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>// if the &quot;FirstName&quot; session value has not yet been set,
// then this line will throw a NullReferenceException
string firstName = Session[&quot;FirstName&quot;].ToString();
</code></pre>
<h3>ASP.NET MVC empty view models</h3>
<p>If the exception occurs when referencing a property of <code>@Model</code> in an <code>ASP.NET MVC View</code>, you need to understand that the <code>Model</code> gets set in your action method, when you <code>return</code> a view. When you return an empty model (or model property) from your controller, the exception occurs when the views access it:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>// Controller
public class Restaurant:Controller
{
    public ActionResult Search()
    {
        return View();  // Forgot the provide a Model here.
    }
}

// Razor view 
@foreach (var restaurantSearch in Model.RestaurantSearch)  // Throws.
{
}
    
&lt;p&gt;@Model.somePropertyName&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- Also throws --&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3>WPF Control Creation Order and Events</h3>
<p><code>WPF</code> controls are created during the call to <code>InitializeComponent</code> in the order they appear in the visual tree.  A <code>NullReferenceException</code> will be raised in the case of early-created controls with event handlers, etc., that fire during <code>InitializeComponent</code> which reference late-created controls.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;Grid&gt;
    &lt;!-- Combobox declared first --&gt;
    &lt;ComboBox Name=&quot;comboBox1&quot; 
              Margin=&quot;10&quot;
              SelectedIndex=&quot;0&quot; 
              SelectionChanged=&quot;comboBox1_SelectionChanged&quot;&gt;
       &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=&quot;Item 1&quot; /&gt;
       &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=&quot;Item 2&quot; /&gt;
       &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=&quot;Item 3&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/ComboBox&gt;
        
    &lt;!-- Label declared later --&gt;
    &lt;Label Name=&quot;label1&quot; 
           Content=&quot;Label&quot;
           Margin=&quot;10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/Grid&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Here <code>comboBox1</code> is created before <code>label1</code>. If <code>comboBox1_SelectionChanged</code> attempts to reference `label1, it will not yet have been created.</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>private void comboBox1_SelectionChanged(object sender, SelectionChangedEventArgs e)
{
    label1.Content = comboBox1.SelectedIndex.ToString(); // NullReferenceException here!!
}
</code></pre>
<p>Changing the order of the declarations in the <code>XAML</code> (i.e., listing <code>label1</code> before <code>comboBox1</code>, ignoring issues of design philosophy) would at least resolve the <code>NullReferenceException</code> here.</p>
<h3>Cast with <code>as</code></h3>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>var myThing = someObject as Thing;
</code></pre>
<p>This doesn't throw an <code>InvalidCastException</code> but returns a <code>null</code> when the cast fails (and when <code>someObject</code> is itself null). So be aware of that.</p>
<h3>LINQ <code>FirstOrDefault()</code> and <code>SingleOrDefault()</code></h3>
<p>The plain versions <code>First()</code> and <code>Single()</code> throw exceptions when there is nothing. The &quot;OrDefault&quot; versions return <code>null</code> in that case. So be aware of that.</p>
<h3>foreach</h3>
<p><code>foreach</code> throws when you try to iterate on a <code>null</code> collection. Usually caused by unexpected <code>null</code> result from methods that return collections.</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>List&lt;int&gt; list = null;    
foreach(var v in list) { } // NullReferenceException here
</code></pre>
<p>More realistic example - select nodes from XML document. Will throw if nodes are not found but initial debugging shows that all properties valid:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>foreach (var node in myData.MyXml.DocumentNode.SelectNodes(&quot;//Data&quot;))
</code></pre>
<hr />
<h1>Ways to Avoid</h1>
<h3>Explicitly check for <code>null</code> and ignore <code>null</code> values.</h3>
<p>If you expect the reference sometimes to be <code>null</code>, you can check for it being <code>null</code> before accessing instance members:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>void PrintName(Person p)
{
    if (p != null) 
    {
        Console.WriteLine(p.Name);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Explicitly check for <code>null</code> and provide a default value.</h3>
<p>Methods you call expecting an instance can return <code>null</code>, for example when the object being sought cannot be found. You can choose to return a default value when this is the case:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>string GetCategory(Book b) 
{
    if (b == null)
        return &quot;Unknown&quot;;
    return b.Category;
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Explicitly check for <code>null</code> from method calls and throw a custom exception.</h3>
<p>You can also throw a custom exception, only to catch it in the calling code:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>string GetCategory(string bookTitle) 
{
    var book = library.FindBook(bookTitle);  // This may return null
    if (book == null)
        throw new BookNotFoundException(bookTitle);  // Your custom exception
    return book.Category;
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Use <code>Debug.Assert</code> if a value should never be <code>null</code>, to catch the problem earlier than the exception occurs.</h3>
<p>When you know during development that a method could, but never should return <code>null</code>, you can use <code>Debug.Assert()</code> to break as soon as possible when it does occur:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>string GetTitle(int knownBookID) 
{
    // You know this should never return null.
    var book = library.GetBook(knownBookID);  

    // Exception will occur on the next line instead of at the end of this method.
    Debug.Assert(book != null, &quot;Library didn't return a book for known book ID.&quot;);

    // Some other code

    return book.Title; // Will never throw NullReferenceException in Debug mode.
}
</code></pre>
<p>Though this check <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3021538/debug-assert-appears-in-release-mode"">will not end up in your release build</a>, causing it to throw the <code>NullReferenceException</code> again when <code>book == null</code> at runtime in release mode.</p>
<h3>Use <code>GetValueOrDefault()</code> for <code>nullable</code> value types to provide a default value when they are <code>null</code>.</h3>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>DateTime? appointment = null;
Console.WriteLine(appointment.GetValueOrDefault(DateTime.Now));
// Will display the default value provided (DateTime.Now), because appointment is null.

appointment = new DateTime(2022, 10, 20);
Console.WriteLine(appointment.GetValueOrDefault(DateTime.Now));
// Will display the appointment date, not the default
</code></pre>
<h3>Use the null coalescing operator: <code>??</code> [C#] or <code>If()</code> [VB].</h3>
<p>The shorthand to providing a default value when a <code>null</code> is encountered:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>IService CreateService(ILogger log, Int32? frobPowerLevel)
{
   var serviceImpl = new MyService(log ?? NullLog.Instance);
 
   // Note that the above &quot;GetValueOrDefault()&quot; can also be rewritten to use
   // the coalesce operator:
   serviceImpl.FrobPowerLevel = frobPowerLevel ?? 5;
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Use the null condition operator: <code>?.</code> or <code>?[x]</code> for arrays (available in C# 6 and VB.NET 14):</h3>
<p>This is also sometimes called the safe navigation or Elvis (after its shape) operator. If the expression on the left side of the operator is null, then the right side will not be evaluated, and null is returned instead. That means cases like this:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>var title = person.Title.ToUpper();
</code></pre>
<p>If the person does not have a title, this will throw an exception because it is trying to call <code>ToUpper</code> on a property with a null value.</p>
<p>In <code>C# 5</code> and below, this can be guarded with:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>var title = person.Title == null ? null : person.Title.ToUpper();
</code></pre>
<p>Now the title variable will be null instead of throwing an exception. C# 6 introduces a shorter syntax for this:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>var title = person.Title?.ToUpper();
</code></pre>
<p>This will result in the title variable being <code>null</code>, and the call to <code>ToUpper</code> is not made if <code>person.Title</code> is <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>Of course, you <em>still</em> have to check <code>title</code> for <code>null</code> or use the null condition operator together with the null coalescing operator (<code>??</code>) to supply a default value:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>// regular null check
int titleLength = 0;
if (title != null)
    titleLength = title.Length; // If title is null, this would throw NullReferenceException
    
// combining the `?` and the `??` operator
int titleLength = title?.Length ?? 0;
</code></pre>
<p>Likewise, for arrays you can use <code>?[i]</code> as follows:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>int[] myIntArray = null;
var i = 5;
int? elem = myIntArray?[i];
if (!elem.HasValue) Console.WriteLine(&quot;No value&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>This will do the following: If <code>myIntArray</code> is <code>null</code>, the expression returns <code>null</code> and you can safely check it. If it contains an array, it will do the same as:
<code>elem = myIntArray[i];</code> and returns the i<sup>th</sup> element.</p>
<h3>Use null context (available in C# 8):</h3>
<p>Introduced in <code>C# 8</code>, null contexts and nullable reference types perform static analysis on variables and provide a compiler warning if a value can be potentially <code>null</code> or have been set to <code>null</code>. The nullable reference types allow types to be explicitly allowed to be <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>The nullable annotation context and nullable warning context can be set for a project using the <code>Nullable</code> element in your <code>csproj</code> file. This element configures how the compiler interprets the nullability of types and what warnings are generated. Valid settings are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>enable</code>: The nullable annotation context is enabled. The nullable warning context is enabled. Variables of a reference type, string, for example, are non-nullable. All nullability warnings are enabled.</li>
<li><code>disable</code>: The nullable annotation context is disabled. The nullable warning context is disabled. Variables of a reference type are oblivious, just like earlier versions of C#. All nullability warnings are disabled.</li>
<li><code>safeonly</code>: The nullable annotation context is enabled. The nullable warning context is safeonly. Variables of a reference type are non-nullable. All safety nullability warnings are enabled.</li>
<li><code>warnings</code>: The nullable annotation context is disabled. The nullable warning context is enabled. Variables of a reference type are oblivious. All nullability warnings are enabled.</li>
<li><code>safeonlywarnings</code>: The nullable annotation context is disabled. The nullable warning context is safeonly.
Variables of a reference type are oblivious. All safety nullability warnings are enabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>A nullable reference type is noted using the same syntax as nullable value types: a <code>?</code> is appended to the type of the variable.</p>
<h3>Special techniques for debugging and fixing null derefs in iterators</h3>
<p><code>C#</code> supports &quot;iterator blocks&quot; (called &quot;generators&quot; in some other popular languages). <code>NullReferenceException</code> can be particularly tricky to debug in iterator blocks because of deferred execution:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>public IEnumerable&lt;Frob&gt; GetFrobs(FrobFactory f, int count)
{
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; ++i)
    yield return f.MakeFrob();
}
...
FrobFactory factory = whatever;
IEnumerable&lt;Frobs&gt; frobs = GetFrobs();
...
foreach(Frob frob in frobs) { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>whatever</code> results in <code>null</code> then <code>MakeFrob</code> will throw. Now, you might think that the right thing to do is this:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>// DON'T DO THIS
public IEnumerable&lt;Frob&gt; GetFrobs(FrobFactory f, int count)
{
   if (f == null) 
      throw new ArgumentNullException(&quot;f&quot;, &quot;factory must not be null&quot;);
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; ++i)
      yield return f.MakeFrob();
}
</code></pre>
<p>Why is this wrong?  Because the iterator block does not actually <em>run</em> until the <code>foreach</code>!  The call to <code>GetFrobs</code> simply returns an object which <em>when iterated</em> will run the iterator block.</p>
<p>By writing a <code>null</code> check like this you prevent the <code>NullReferenceException</code>, but you move the <code>NullArgumentException</code> to the point of the <em>iteration</em>, not to the point of the <em>call</em>, and that is <em>very confusing to debug</em>.</p>
<p>The correct fix is:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>// DO THIS
public IEnumerable&lt;Frob&gt; GetFrobs(FrobFactory f, int count)
{
   // No yields in a public method that throws!
   if (f == null) 
       throw new ArgumentNullException(&quot;f&quot;, &quot;factory must not be null&quot;);
   return GetFrobsForReal(f, count);
}
private IEnumerable&lt;Frob&gt; GetFrobsForReal(FrobFactory f, int count)
{
   // Yields in a private method
   Debug.Assert(f != null);
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; ++i)
        yield return f.MakeFrob();
}
</code></pre>
<p>That is, make a private helper method that has the iterator block logic and a public surface method that does the <code>null</code> check and returns the iterator. Now when <code>GetFrobs</code> is called, the <code>null</code> check happens immediately, and then <code>GetFrobsForReal</code> executes when the sequence is iterated.</p>
<p>If you examine the reference source for <code>LINQ</code> to Objects you will see that this technique is used throughout. It is slightly more clunky to write, but it makes debugging nullity errors much easier. <strong>Optimize your code for the convenience of the caller, not the convenience of the author</strong>.</p>
<h3>A note on null dereferences in unsafe code</h3>
<p><code>C#</code> has an &quot;unsafe&quot; mode which is, as the name implies, extremely dangerous because the normal safety mechanisms which provide memory safety and type safety are not enforced. <strong>You should not be writing unsafe code unless you have a thorough and deep understanding of how memory works</strong>.</p>
<p>In unsafe mode, you should be aware of two important facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>dereferencing a null <strong>pointer</strong> produces the same exception as dereferencing a null <strong>reference</strong></li>
<li>dereferencing an invalid non-null pointer <strong>can</strong> produce that exception in some circumstances</li>
</ul>
<p>To understand why that is, it helps to understand how .NET produces <code>NullReferenceException</code> in the first place. (These details apply to .NET running on Windows; other operating systems use similar mechanisms.)</p>
<p>Memory is virtualized in <code>Windows</code>; each process gets a virtual memory space of many &quot;pages&quot; of memory that are tracked by the operating system. Each page of memory has flags set on it that determine how it may be used: read from, written to, executed, and so on. The <em>lowest</em> page is marked as &quot;produce an error if ever used in any way&quot;.</p>
<p>Both a null pointer and a null reference in <code>C#</code> are internally represented as the number zero, and so any attempt to dereference it into its corresponding memory storage causes the operating system to produce an error. The .NET runtime then detects this error and turns it into the <code>NullReferenceException</code>.</p>
<p>That's why dereferencing both a null pointer and a null reference produces the same exception.</p>
<p>What about the second point? Dereferencing <em>any</em> invalid pointer that falls in the lowest page of virtual memory causes the same operating system error, and thereby the same exception.</p>
<p>Why does this make sense?  Well, suppose we have a struct containing two ints, and an unmanaged pointer equal to null. If we attempt to dereference the second int in the struct, the <code>CLR</code> will not attempt to access the storage at location zero; it will access the storage at location four. But logically this is a null dereference because we are getting to that address <em>via</em> the null.</p>
<p>If you are working with unsafe code and you get a <code>NullReferenceException</code>, just be aware that the offending pointer need not be null. It can be any location in the lowest page, and this exception will be produced.</p>

<h2>Current Answer</h2>

<p>You can use <a href=""http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_existssync_path"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>fs.existsSync()</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>const fs = require(""fs""); // Or `import fs from ""fs"";` with ESM

<p>It was deprecated for several years, but no longer is. From the docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that <code>fs.exists()</code> is deprecated, but <code>fs.existsSync()</code> is not. (The
  callback parameter to <code>fs.exists()</code> accepts parameters that are
  inconsistent with other Node.js callbacks. <code>fs.existsSync()</code> does not
  use a callback.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You've specifically asked for a <em>synchronous</em> check, but if you can use an <em>asynchronous</em> check instead (usually best with I/O), use <a href=""https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fspromises_access_path_mode"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>fs.promises.access</code></a> if you're using <code>async</code> functions or <a href=""https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_access_path_mode_callback"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>fs.access</code></a> (since <a href=""http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_exists_path_callback"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>exists</code> is deprecated</a>) if not:</p>

<p>In an <code>async</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>try {
    await fs.promises.access(""somefile"");
    // The check succeeded
} catch (error) {
    // The check failed

</code></pre>

<p>Or with a callback:</p>

<pre><code>fs.access(""somefile"", error =&gt; {
    if (!error) {
        // The check succeeded

<h3>Original answer from 2010:</h3>

<p>You can use <code>statSync</code> or <code>lstatSync</code> (<a href=""http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_lstatsync_path"" rel=""noreferrer"">docs link</a>), which give you an <a href=""http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>fs.Stats</code> object</a>. In general, if a synchronous version of a function is available, it will have the same name as the async version with <code>Sync</code> at the end. So <code>statSync</code> is the synchronous version of <code>stat</code>; <code>lstatSync</code> is the synchronous version of <code>lstat</code>, etc.</p>

<p><code>lstatSync</code> tells you both whether something exists, and if so, whether it's a file or a directory (or in some file systems, a symbolic link, block device, character device, etc.), e.g. if you need to know if it exists and is a directory:</p>

<pre><code>var fs = require('fs');
try {
    // Query the entry
    stats = fs.lstatSync('/the/path');

    // Is it a directory?
    if (stats.isDirectory()) {
        // Yes it is
    }
}
catch (e) {
    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>...and similarly, if it's a file, there's <code>isFile</code>; if it's a block device, there's <code>isBlockDevice</code>, etc., etc. Note the <code>try/catch</code>; it throws an error if the entry doesn't exist at all.</p>

<p><s>If you don't care what the entry <em>is</em> and only want to know whether it exists, you can use <a href=""http://nodejs.org/api/path.html#path_path_existssync_p"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>path.existsSync</code></a> (or with latest, <code>fs.existsSync</code>) as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/5008295/157247"">noted by user618408</a>:</p>

<pre><code>var path = require('path');
if (path.existsSync(""/the/path"")) { // or fs.existsSync
    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn't require a <code>try/catch</code> but gives you no information about what the thing is, just that it's there.</s> <code>path.existsSync</code> was deprecated long ago.</p>

<hr>

<p>Side note: You've expressly asked how to check <em>synchronously</em>, so I've used the <code>xyzSync</code> versions of the functions above. But wherever possible, with I/O, it really is best to avoid synchronous calls. Calls into the I/O subsystem take significant time from a CPU's point of view. Note how easy it is to call <a href=""http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_lstat_path_callback"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>lstat</code></a> rather than <code>lstatSync</code>:</p>

<pre><code>// Is it a directory?
lstat('/the/path', function(err, stats) {
    if (!err &amp;&amp; stats.isDirectory()) {
        // Yes it is
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>But if you need the synchronous version, it's there.</p>

<h3>Update September 2012</h3>

<p>The below answer from a couple of years ago is now a bit out of date. The current way is to use <a href=""http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_existssync_path"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>fs.existsSync</code></a> to do a synchronous check for file/directory existence (or of course  <a href=""http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_exists_path_callback"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>fs.exists</code></a> for an asynchronous check), rather than the <code>path</code> versions below.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>var fs = require('fs');

if (fs.existsSync(path)) {
    // Do something
}

// Or

fs.exists(path, function(exists) {
    if (exists) {
        // Do something
    }
});
</code></pre>

<h3>Update February 2015</h3>

<p>And here we are in 2015 and the Node docs now say that <code>fs.existsSync</code> (and <code>fs.exists</code>) ""will be deprecated"". (Because the Node folks think it's dumb to check whether something exists before opening it, which it is; but that's not the only reason for checking whether something exists!)</p>

<p>So we're probably back to the various <code>stat</code> methods... Until/unless this changes yet again, of course.</p>

<h3>Update December 2015</h3>

<p>Don't know how long it's been there, but there's also <a href=""https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_access_path_mode_callback"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>fs.access(path, fs.F_OK, ...)</code> / <code>fs.accessSync(path, fs.F_OK)</code></a>. And at least as of October 2016, the <a href=""https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_stat_path_callback"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>fs.stat</code> documentation</a> recommends using <code>fs.access</code> to do existence checks (<em>""To check if a file exists without manipulating it afterwards, <code>fs.access()</code> is recommended.""</em>). But note that the access not being available is considered an <em>error</em>, so this would probably be best if you're expecting the file to be accessible:</p>

<pre><code>var fs = require('fs');

try {
    fs.accessSync(path, fs.F_OK);
    // Do something
} catch (e) {
    // It isn't accessible
}

// Or

fs.access(path, fs.F_OK, function(err) {
    if (!err) {
        // Do something
    } else {
        // It isn't accessible
    }
});
</code></pre>

<h3>Update December 2016</h3>

<p>You can use <a href=""http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_existssync_path"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>fs.existsSync()</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>if (fs.existsSync(path)) {
    // Do something
}
</code></pre>

<p>It was deprecated for several years, but no longer is. From the docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that <code>fs.exists()</code> is deprecated, but <code>fs.existsSync()</code> is not. (The
  callback parameter to <code>fs.exists()</code> accepts parameters that are
  inconsistent with other Node.js callbacks. <code>fs.existsSync()</code> does not
  use a callback.)</p>

<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>With &quot;<code>git submodule init</code>&quot; the user is able to tell git they care about one or more submodules and wants to have it populated on the next call to &quot;<code>git submodule update</code>&quot;.<br />
But currently there is no easy way they can tell git they do not care about a submodule anymore and wants to get rid of the local work tree (unless the user knows a lot about submodule internals and removes the &quot;<code>submodule.$name.url</code>&quot; setting from <code>.git/config</code> together with the work tree himself).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Help those users by providing a '<strong><code>deinit</code></strong>' command.<br />
This <strong>removes the whole <code>submodule.&lt;name&gt;</code> section from <code>.git/config</code> either for the given
submodule(s)</strong> (or for all those which have been initialized if '<code>.</code>' is given).<br />
Fail if the current work tree contains modifications unless forced.<br />
Complain when for a submodule given on the command line the url setting can't be found in <code>.git/config</code>, but nonetheless don't fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This takes care if the (de)initialization steps (<code>.git/config</code> and <code>.git/modules/xxx</code>)</p>
<p>Since git1.8.5, the <code>git rm</code> takes <em>also</em> care of the:</p>
<ul>
<li>'<code>add</code>' step which records the url of a submodule in the <code>.gitmodules</code> file: it is need to removed for you.</li>
<li>the submodule <strong><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1992018/git-submodule-update-needed-only-initially/2227598#2227598"">special entry</a></strong> (as illustrated by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/16574625/6309"">this question</a>): the git rm removes it from the index:<br />
<code>git rm --cached path_to_submodule</code> (no trailing slash)<br />
That will remove that directory stored in the index with a special mode &quot;160000&quot;, marking it as a submodule root directory.</li>

<p>So <strong>hashing</strong> would be enough (and faster).</p>

<ol>
<li>For each color of socks, <strong>form a pile</strong>. Iterate over all socks in your input basket <strong>and distribute them onto the color piles</strong>.</li>
<li>Iterate over each pile and <strong>distribute it by some other metric</strong> (e.g. pattern) into the second set of piles</li>
<li><strong>Recursively apply this scheme</strong> until you have distributed all socks onto <strong>very small piles that you can visually process immediately</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>This kind of recursive hash partitioning is actually being done by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server"" rel=""noreferrer"">SQL Server</a> when it needs to hash join or hash aggregate over huge data sets. It distributes its build input stream into many partitions which are independent. This scheme scales to arbitrary amounts of data and multiple CPUs linearly.</p>

<p>You don't need recursive partitioning if you can find a distribution key (hash key) that <strong>provides enough buckets</strong> that each bucket is small enough to be processed very quickly. Unfortunately, I don't think socks have such a property.</p>

<p>If each sock had an integer called ""PairID"" one could easily distribute them into 10 buckets according to <code>PairID % 10</code> (the last digit).</p>

<p>The best real-world partitioning I can think of is creating a <strong>rectangle of piles</strong>: one dimension is color, the other is the pattern. Why a rectangle? Because we need O(1) random-access to piles. (A 3D <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboid"" rel=""noreferrer"">cuboid</a> would also work, but that is not very practical.)</p>

<hr/>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>What about <strong>parallelism</strong>? Can multiple humans match the socks faster?</p>

<ol>
<li>The simplest parallelization strategy is to have multiple workers take from the input basket and put the socks onto the piles. This only scales up so much - imagine 100 people fighting over 10 piles. <strong>The synchronization costs</strong> (manifesting themselves as hand-collisions and human communication) <strong>destroy efficiency and speed-up</strong> (see the <a href=""http://www.perfdynamics.com/Manifesto/USLscalability.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Universal Scalability Law</a>!). Is this prone to <strong>deadlocks</strong>? No, because each worker only needs to access one pile at a time. With just one ""lock"" there cannot be a deadlock. <strong>Livelocks</strong> might be possible depending on how the humans coordinate access to piles. They might just use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff"" rel=""noreferrer"">random backoff</a> like network cards do that on a physical level to determine what card can exclusively access the network wire. If it works for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_interface_controller"" rel=""noreferrer"">NICs</a>, it should work for humans as well.</li>
<li>It scales nearly indefinitely if <strong>each worker has its own set of piles</strong>. Workers can then take big chunks of socks from the input basket (very little contention as they are doing it rarely) and they do not need to synchronise when distributing the socks at all (because they have thread-local piles). At the end, all workers need to union their pile-sets. I believe that can be done in O(log (worker count * piles per worker)) if the workers form an <strong>aggregation tree</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>What about the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_distinctness_problem"" rel=""noreferrer"">element distinctness problem</a>? As the article states, the element distinctness problem can be solved in <code>O(N)</code>. This is the same for the socks problem (also <code>O(N)</code>, if you need only one distribution step (I proposed multiple steps only because humans are bad at calculations - one step is enough if you distribute on <code>md5(color, length, pattern, ...)</code>, i.e. a <strong>perfect hash</strong> of all attributes)).</p>

<p>Clearly, one cannot go faster than <code>O(N)</code>, so we have reached the <strong>optimal lower bound</strong>.</p>

<p>Although the outputs are not exactly the same (in one case, just a boolean. In the other case, the pairs of socks), the asymptotic complexities are the same.</p>

This is faster to execute than an <code>onload</code> handler because this waits only for the DOM to be ready, not for all images to load.  And, this works in every browser.</p>

<p>For modern browsers (anything from IE9 and newer and any version of Chrome, Firefox or Safari), if you want to be able to implement a jQuery like <code>$(document).ready()</code> method that you can call from anywhere (without worrying about where the calling script is positioned), you can just use something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function docReady(fn) {
    // see if DOM is already available
    if (document.readyState === ""complete"" || document.readyState === ""interactive"") {
        // call on next available tick
        setTimeout(fn, 1);
    } else {
        document.addEventListener(""DOMContentLoaded"", fn);
    }
}

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code>docReady(function() {
    // DOM is loaded and ready for manipulation here
});
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>If you need full cross browser compatibility (including old versions of IE) and you don't want to wait for <code>window.onload</code>, then you probably should go look at how a framework like jQuery implements its <code>$(document).ready()</code> method.  It's fairly involved depending upon the capabilities of the browser.</p>

<p>To give you a little idea what jQuery does (which will work wherever the script tag is placed).</p>

<p>If supported, it tries the standard:</p>

<pre><code>document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', fn, false);
</code></pre>

<p>with a fallback to:</p>

<pre><code>window.addEventListener('load', fn, false )
</code></pre>

<p>or for older versions of IE, it uses:</p>

<pre><code>document.attachEvent(""onreadystatechange"", fn);
</code></pre>

<p>with a fallback to:</p>

<pre><code>window.attachEvent(""onload"", fn);
</code></pre>

<p>And, there are some work-arounds in the IE code path that I don't quite follow, but it looks like it has something to do with frames.</p>

<p>Here's a summary of how it works:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create an <a href=""http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/"" rel=""noreferrer"">IIFE</a> (immediately invoked function expression) so we can have non-public state variables.</li>
<li>Declare a public function <code>docReady(fn, context)</code></li>
<li>When <code>docReady(fn, context)</code> is called, check if the ready handler has already fired.  If so, just schedule the newly added callback to fire right after this thread of JS finishes with <code>setTimeout(fn, 1)</code>.</li>
<li>If the ready handler has not already fired, then add this new callback to the list of callbacks to be called later.</li>
<li>Check if the document is already ready.  If so, execute all ready handlers.</li>
<li>If we haven't installed event listeners yet to know when the document becomes ready, then install them now.</li>
<li>If <code>document.addEventListener</code> exists, then install event handlers using <code>.addEventListener()</code> for both <code>""DOMContentLoaded""</code> and <code>""load""</code> events.  The ""load"" is a backup event for safety and should not be needed.</li>
<li>If <code>document.addEventListener</code> doesn't exist, then install event handlers using <code>.attachEvent()</code> for <code>""onreadystatechange""</code> and <code>""onload""</code> events.</li>
<li>In the <code>onreadystatechange</code> event, check to see if the <code>document.readyState === ""complete""</code> and if so, call a function to fire all the ready handlers.</li>
<li>In all the other event handlers, call a function to fire all the ready handlers.</li>
<li>In the function to call all the ready handlers, check a state variable to see if we've already fired.  If we have, do nothing.  If we haven't yet been called, then loop through the array of ready functions and call each one in the order they were added.  Set a flag to indicate these have all been called so they are never executed more than once.</li>
<li>Clear the function array so any closures they might be using can be freed.</li>
</ol>

<p>Handlers registered with <code>docReady()</code> are guaranteed to be fired in the order they were registered.</p>

<p>If you call <code>docReady(fn)</code> after the document is already ready, the callback will be scheduled to execute as soon as the current thread of execution completes using <code>setTimeout(fn, 1)</code>.  This allows the calling code to always assume they are async callbacks that will be called later, even if later is as soon as the current thread of JS finishes and it preserves calling order.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The serialization runtime associates with each serializable class a version number, called a <code>serialVersionUID</code>, which is used during deserialization to verify that the sender and receiver of a serialized object have loaded classes for that object that are compatible with respect to serialization.

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>ANY-ACCESS-MODIFIER static final long serialVersionUID = 42L;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If a serializable class does not explicitly declare a <code>serialVersionUID</code>, then the serialization runtime will calculate a default <code>serialVersionUID</code> value for that class based on various aspects of the class, as described in the Java(TM) Object Serialization Specification. However, it is <em>strongly recommended</em> that all serializable classes explicitly declare <code>serialVersionUID</code> values, since the default <code>serialVersionUID</code> computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations, and can thus result in unexpected <code>InvalidClassExceptions</code> during deserialization. Therefore, to guarantee a consistent <code>serialVersionUID</code> value across different java compiler implementations, a serializable class must declare an explicit <code>serialVersionUID</code> value. It is also strongly advised that explicit <code>serialVersionUID</code> declarations use the private modifier where possible, since such declarations apply only to the immediately declaring class — <code>serialVersionUID</code> fields are not useful as inherited members.</p>

<li><p>For values which are &quot;naturally exact decimals&quot; it's good to use <code>decimal</code>.

<li><p>For values which are more artefacts of nature which can't really be measured <em>exactly</em> anyway, <code>float</code>/<code>double</code> are more appropriate.

<h3>Why do we need the copy-and-swap idiom?</h3>
<p>Any class that manages a resource (a <em>wrapper</em>, like a smart pointer) needs to implement <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4172722/what-is-the-rule-of-three"">The Big Three</a>. While the goals and implementation of the copy-constructor and destructor are straightforward, the copy-assignment operator is arguably the most nuanced and difficult. How should it be done? What pitfalls need to be avoided?</p>
<p>The <em>copy-and-swap idiom</em> is the solution, and elegantly assists the assignment operator in achieving two things: avoiding <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself"" rel=""noreferrer"">code duplication</a>, and providing a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_guarantees"" rel=""noreferrer"">strong exception guarantee</a>.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3279543/what-is-the-copy-and-swap-idiom/3279616#3279616"">Conceptually</a>, it works by using the copy-constructor's functionality to create a local copy of the data, then takes the copied data with a <code>swap</code> function, swapping the old data with the new data. The temporary copy then destructs, taking the old data with it. We are left with a copy of the new data.</p>
<p>In order to use the copy-and-swap idiom, we need three things: a working copy-constructor, a working destructor (both are the basis of any wrapper, so should be complete anyway), and a <code>swap</code> function.</p>
<p>A swap function is a <em>non-throwing</em> function that swaps two objects of a class, member for member. We might be tempted to use <code>std::swap</code> instead of providing our own, but this would be impossible; <code>std::swap</code> uses the copy-constructor and copy-assignment operator within its implementation, and we'd ultimately be trying to define the assignment operator in terms of itself!</p>
<p>(Not only that, but unqualified calls to <code>swap</code> will use our custom swap operator, skipping over the unnecessary construction and destruction of our class that <code>std::swap</code> would entail.)</p>
<hr />
<h1>An in-depth explanation</h1>
<h3>The goal</h3>
<p>Let's consider a concrete case. We want to manage, in an otherwise useless class, a dynamic array. We start with a working constructor, copy-constructor, and destructor:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;algorithm&gt; // std::copy
#include &lt;cstddef&gt; // std::size_t

class dumb_array
{
public:
    // (default) constructor
    dumb_array(std::size_t size = 0)
        : mSize(size),
          mArray(mSize ? new int[mSize]() : nullptr)
    {
    }

    // copy-constructor
    dumb_array(const dumb_array&amp; other)
        : mSize(other.mSize),
          mArray(mSize ? new int[mSize] : nullptr)
    {
        // note that this is non-throwing, because of the data
        // types being used; more attention to detail with regards
        // to exceptions must be given in a more general case, however
        std::copy(other.mArray, other.mArray + mSize, mArray);
    }

    // destructor
    ~dumb_array()
    {
        delete [] mArray;
    }

private:
    std::size_t mSize;
    int* mArray;
};
</code></pre>
<p>This class almost manages the array successfully, but it needs <code>operator=</code> to work correctly.</p>
<h3>A failed solution</h3>
<p>Here's how a naive implementation might look:</p>
<pre><code>// the hard part
dumb_array&amp; operator=(const dumb_array&amp; other)
{
    if (this != &amp;other) // (1)
    {
        // get rid of the old data...
        delete [] mArray; // (2)
        mArray = nullptr; // (2) *(see footnote for rationale)

        // ...and put in the new
        mSize = other.mSize; // (3)
        mArray = mSize ? new int[mSize] : nullptr; // (3)
        std::copy(other.mArray, other.mArray + mSize, mArray); // (3)
    }

    return *this;
}
</code></pre>
<p>And we say we're finished; this now manages an array, without leaks. However, it suffers from three problems, marked sequentially in the code as <code>(n)</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The first is the self-assignment test.<br />
This check serves two purposes: it's an easy way to prevent us from running needless code on self-assignment, and it protects us from subtle bugs (such as deleting the array only to try and copy it). But in all other cases it merely serves to slow the program down, and act as noise in the code; self-assignment rarely occurs, so most of the time this check is a waste.<br />
It would be better if the operator could work properly without it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The second is that it only provides a basic exception guarantee. If <code>new int[mSize]</code> fails, <code>*this</code> will have been modified. (Namely, the size is wrong and the data is gone!)<br />
For a strong exception guarantee, it would need to be something akin to:</p>
<pre><code> dumb_array&amp; operator=(const dumb_array&amp; other)
 {
     if (this != &amp;other) // (1)
     {
         // get the new data ready before we replace the old
         std::size_t newSize = other.mSize;
         int* newArray = newSize ? new int[newSize]() : nullptr; // (3)
         std::copy(other.mArray, other.mArray + newSize, newArray); // (3)

         // replace the old data (all are non-throwing)
         delete [] mArray;
         mSize = newSize;
         mArray = newArray;
     }

     return *this;
 }
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>The code has expanded! Which leads us to the third problem: code duplication.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Our assignment operator effectively duplicates all the code we've already written elsewhere, and that's a terrible thing.</p>
<p>In our case, the core of it is only two lines (the allocation and the copy), but with more complex resources this code bloat can be quite a hassle. We should strive to never repeat ourselves.</p>
<p>(One might wonder: if this much code is needed to manage one resource correctly, what if my class manages more than one?<br />
While this may seem to be a valid concern, and indeed it requires non-trivial <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> clauses, this is a non-issue.<br />
That's because a class should manage <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>one resource only</em></a>!)</p>
<h3>A successful solution</h3>
<p>As mentioned, the copy-and-swap idiom will fix all these issues. But right now, we have all the requirements except one: a <code>swap</code> function. While The Rule of Three successfully entails the existence of our copy-constructor, assignment operator, and destructor, it should really be called &quot;The Big Three and A Half&quot;: any time your class manages a resource it also makes sense to provide a <code>swap</code> function.</p>
<p>We need to add swap functionality to our class, and we do that as follows†:</p>
<pre><code>class dumb_array
{
public:
    // ...

    friend void swap(dumb_array&amp; first, dumb_array&amp; second) // nothrow
    {
        // enable ADL (not necessary in our case, but good practice)
        using std::swap;

        // by swapping the members of two objects,
        // the two objects are effectively swapped
        swap(first.mSize, second.mSize);
        swap(first.mArray, second.mArray);
    }

    // ...
};
</code></pre>
<p>(<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5695548/public-friend-swap-member-function"">Here</a> is the explanation why <code>public friend swap</code>.) Now not only can we swap our <code>dumb_array</code>'s, but swaps in general can be more efficient; it merely swaps pointers and sizes, rather than allocating and copying entire arrays. Aside from this bonus in functionality and efficiency, we are now ready to implement the copy-and-swap idiom.</p>
<p>Without further ado, our assignment operator is:</p>
<pre><code>dumb_array&amp; operator=(dumb_array other) // (1)
{
    swap(*this, other); // (2)

    return *this;
}
</code></pre>
<p>And that's it! With one fell swoop, all three problems are elegantly tackled at once.</p>
<h3>Why does it work?</h3>
<p>We first notice an important choice: the parameter argument is taken <em>by-value</em>. While one could just as easily do the following (and indeed, many naive implementations of the idiom do):</p>
<pre><code>dumb_array&amp; operator=(const dumb_array&amp; other)
{
    dumb_array temp(other);
    swap(*this, temp);

    return *this;
}
</code></pre>
<p>We lose an <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20140113221447/http://cpp-next.com/archive/2009/08/want-speed-pass-by-value/"" rel=""noreferrer"">important optimization opportunity</a>. Not only that, but this choice is critical in C++11, which is discussed later. (On a general note, a remarkably useful guideline is as follows: if you're going to make a copy of something in a function, let the compiler do it in the parameter list.‡)</p>
<p>Either way, this method of obtaining our resource is the key to eliminating code duplication: we get to use the code from the copy-constructor to make the copy, and never need to repeat any bit of it. Now that the copy is made, we are ready to swap.</p>
<p>Observe that upon entering the function that all the new data is already allocated, copied, and ready to be used. This is what gives us a strong exception guarantee for free: we won't even enter the function if construction of the copy fails, and it's therefore not possible to alter the state of <code>*this</code>. (What we did manually before for a strong exception guarantee, the compiler is doing for us now; how kind.)</p>
<p>At this point we are home-free, because <code>swap</code> is non-throwing. We swap our current data with the copied data, safely altering our state, and the old data gets put into the temporary. The old data is then released when the function returns. (Where upon the parameter's scope ends and its destructor is called.)</p>
<p>Because the idiom repeats no code, we cannot introduce bugs within the operator. Note that this means we are rid of the need for a self-assignment check, allowing a single uniform implementation of <code>operator=</code>. (Additionally, we no longer have a performance penalty on non-self-assignments.)</p>
<p>And that is the copy-and-swap idiom.</p>
<h2>What about C++11?</h2>
<p>The next version of C++, C++11, makes one very important change to how we manage resources: the Rule of Three is now <strong>The Rule of Four</strong> (and a half). Why? Because not only do we need to be able to copy-construct our resource, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3106110/can-someone-please-explain-move-semantics-to-me"">we need to move-construct it as well</a>.</p>
<p>Luckily for us, this is easy:</p>
<pre><code>class dumb_array
{
public:
    // ...

    // move constructor
    dumb_array(dumb_array&amp;&amp; other) noexcept ††
        : dumb_array() // initialize via default constructor, C++11 only
    {
        swap(*this, other);
    }

    // ...
};
</code></pre>
<p>What's going on here? Recall the goal of move-construction: to take the resources from another instance of the class, leaving it in a state guaranteed to be assignable and destructible.</p>
<p>So what we've done is simple: initialize via the default constructor (a C++11 feature), then swap with <code>other</code>; we know a default constructed instance of our class can safely be assigned and destructed, so we know <code>other</code> will be able to do the same, after swapping.</p>
<p>(Note that some compilers do not support constructor delegation; in this case, we have to manually default construct the class. This is an unfortunate but luckily trivial task.)</p>
<h3>Why does that work?</h3>
<p>That is the only change we need to make to our class, so why does it work? Remember the ever-important decision we made to make the parameter a value and not a reference:</p>
<pre><code>dumb_array&amp; operator=(dumb_array other); // (1)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, if <code>other</code> is being initialized with an rvalue, <em>it will be move-constructed</em>. Perfect. In the same way C++03 let us re-use our copy-constructor functionality by taking the argument by-value, C++11 will <em>automatically</em> pick the move-constructor when appropriate as well. (And, of course, as mentioned in previously linked article, the copying/moving of the value may simply be elided altogether.)</p>
<p>And so concludes the copy-and-swap idiom.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Footnotes</h3>
<p>*Why do we set <code>mArray</code> to null? Because if any further code in the operator throws, the destructor of <code>dumb_array</code> might be called; and if that happens without setting it to null, we attempt to delete memory that's already been deleted! We avoid this by setting it to null, as deleting null is a no-operation.</p>
<p>†There are other claims that we should specialize <code>std::swap</code> for our type, provide an in-class <code>swap</code> along-side a free-function <code>swap</code>, etc. But this is all unnecessary: any proper use of <code>swap</code> will be through an unqualified call, and our function will be found through <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument-dependent_name_lookup"" rel=""noreferrer"">ADL</a>. One function will do.</p>
<p>‡The reason is simple: once you have the resource to yourself, you may swap and/or move it (C++11) anywhere it needs to be. And by making the copy in the parameter list, you maximize optimization.</p>
<p>††The move constructor should generally be <code>noexcept</code>, otherwise some code (e.g. <code>std::vector</code> resizing logic) will use the copy constructor even when a move would make sense. Of course, only mark it noexcept if the code inside doesn't throw exceptions.</p>

20279485,2,,20279484,11/29/2013 6:13,,2204,,"<h2>What you should know about <code>this</code></h2>
<p><code>this</code> (aka &quot;the context&quot;) is a special keyword inside each function and its value only depends on <em>how</em> the function was called, not how/when/where it was defined. It is not affected by lexical scopes like other variables (except for arrow functions, see below). Here are some examples:</p>
<pre><code>function foo() {
    console.log(this);
}

// normal function call
foo(); // `this` will refer to `window`

// as object method
var obj = {bar: foo};
obj.bar(); // `this` will refer to `obj`

// as constructor function
new foo(); // `this` will refer to an object that inherits from `foo.prototype`
</code></pre>
<p>To learn more about <code>this</code>, have a look at the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this"" rel=""noreferrer"">MDN documentation</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>How to refer to the correct <code>this</code></h2>
<h3>Use <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions"" rel=""noreferrer"">arrow functions</a></h3>
<p>ECMAScript 6 introduced <em>arrow functions</em>, which can be thought of as lambda functions. They don't have their own <code>this</code> binding. Instead, <code>this</code> is looked up in scope just like a normal variable. That means you don't have to call <code>.bind</code>. That's not the only special behavior they have, please refer to the MDN documentation for more information.</p>
<pre><code>function MyConstructor(data, transport) {
    this.data = data;
    transport.on('data', () =&gt; alert(this.data));
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Don't use <code>this</code></h3>
<p>You actually don't want to access <code>this</code> in particular, but <em>the object it refers to</em>. That's why an easy solution is to simply create a new variable that also refers to that object. The variable can have any name, but common ones are <code>self</code> and <code>that</code>.</p>
<pre><code>function MyConstructor(data, transport) {
    this.data = data;
    var self = this;
    transport.on('data', function() {
        alert(self.data);
    });
}
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>self</code> is a normal variable, it obeys lexical scope rules and is accessible inside the callback. This also has the advantage that you can access the <code>this</code> value of the callback itself.</p>
<h3>Explicitly set <code>this</code> of the callback - part 1</h3>
<p>It might look like you have no control over the value of <code>this</code> because its value is set automatically, but that is actually not the case.</p>
<p>Every function has the method <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>.bind</code> <em><sup>[docs]</sup></em></a>, which returns a new function with <code>this</code> bound to a value. The function has exactly the same behavior as the one you called <code>.bind</code> on, only that <code>this</code> was set by you. No matter how or when that function is called, <code>this</code> will always refer to the passed value.</p>
<pre><code>function MyConstructor(data, transport) {
    this.data = data;
    var boundFunction = (function() { // parenthesis are not necessary
        alert(this.data);             // but might improve readability
    }).bind(this); // &lt;- here we are calling `.bind()` 
    transport.on('data', boundFunction);
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, we are binding the callback's <code>this</code> to the value of <code>MyConstructor</code>'s <code>this</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When a binding context for jQuery, use <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>jQuery.proxy</code> <em><sup>[docs]</sup></em></a> instead. The reason to do this is so that you don't need to store the reference to the function when unbinding an event callback. jQuery handles that internally.</p>
<h3>Set <code>this</code> of the callback - part 2</h3>
<p>Some functions/methods which accept callbacks also accept a value to which the callback's <code>this</code> should refer to. This is basically the same as binding it yourself, but the function/method does it for you. <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Array#map</code> <em><sup>[docs]</sup></em></a> is such a method. Its signature is:</p>
<pre><code>array.map(callback[, thisArg])
</code></pre>
<p>The first argument is the callback and the second argument is the value <code>this</code> should refer to. Here is a contrived example:</p>
<pre><code>var arr = [1, 2, 3];
var obj = {multiplier: 42};

var new_arr = arr.map(function(v) {
    return v * this.multiplier;
}, obj); // &lt;- here we are passing `obj` as second argument
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Whether or not you can pass a value for <code>this</code> is usually mentioned in the documentation of that function/method. For example, <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/"" rel=""noreferrer"">jQuery's <code>$.ajax</code> method <em><sup>[docs]</sup></em></a> describes an option called <code>context</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This object will be made the context of all Ajax-related callbacks.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Common problem: Using object methods as callbacks/event handlers</h2>
<p>Another common manifestation of this problem is when an object method is used as callback/event handler. Functions are first-class citizens in JavaScript and the term &quot;method&quot; is just a colloquial term for a function that is a value of an object property. But that function doesn't have a specific link to its &quot;containing&quot; object.</p>
<p>Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code>function Foo() {
    this.data = 42,
    document.body.onclick = this.method;
}

Foo.prototype.method = function() {
    console.log(this.data);
};
</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>this.method</code> is assigned as click event handler, but if the <code>document.body</code> is clicked, the value logged will be <code>undefined</code>, because inside the event handler, <code>this</code> refers to the <code>document.body</code>, not the instance of <code>Foo</code>.<br />
As already mentioned at the beginning, what <code>this</code> refers to depends on how the function is <strong>called</strong>, not how it is <strong>defined</strong>.<br />
If the code was like the following, it might be more obvious that the function doesn't have an implicit reference to the object:</p>
<pre><code>function method() {
    console.log(this.data);
}


function Foo() {
    this.data = 42,
    document.body.onclick = this.method;
}

Foo.prototype.method = method;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>The solution</strong> is the same as mentioned above: If available, use <code>.bind</code> to explicitly bind <code>this</code> to a specific value</p>
<pre><code>document.body.onclick = this.method.bind(this);
</code></pre>
<p>or explicitly call the function as a &quot;method&quot; of the object, by using an anonymous function as callback / event handler and assign the object (<code>this</code>) to another variable:</p>
<pre><code>var self = this;
document.body.onclick = function() {
    self.method();
};
</code></pre>
<p>or use an arrow function:</p>
<pre><code>document.body.onclick = () =&gt; this.method();
</code></pre>

<h2>Best way to declare and define global variables</h2>
<p>The clean, reliable way to declare and define global variables is to use
a header file to contain an <code>extern</code> <em>declaration</em> of the variable.</p>
<p>The header is included by the one source file that defines the variable
and by all the source files that reference the variable.
For each program, one source file (and only one source file) defines the
variable.
Similarly, one header file (and only one header file) should declare the
variable.
The header file is crucial; it enables cross-checking between
independent TUs (translation units — think source files) and ensures
consistency.</p>
<p>Although there are other ways of doing it, this method is simple and
reliable.
It is demonstrated by <code>file3.h</code>, <code>file1.c</code> and <code>file2.c</code>:</p>
<h3>file3.h</h3>
<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>extern int global_variable;  /* Declaration of the variable */
</code></pre>
<h3>file1.c</h3>
<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>#include &quot;file3.h&quot;  /* Declaration made available here */
#include &quot;prog1.h&quot;  /* Function declarations */

/* Variable defined here */
int global_variable = 37;    /* Definition checked against declaration */

Both C99 and C11 require functions to be declared or defined before they

I use the keyword <code>extern</code> in front of function declarations in headers
for consistency — to match the <code>extern</code> in front of variable
declarations in headers.
Many people prefer not to use <code>extern</code> in front of function
declarations; the compiler doesn't care — and ultimately, neither do I

<h2>Not so good way to define global variables</h2>
<p>With some (indeed, many) C compilers, you can get away with what's
called a 'common' definition of a variable too.
'Common', here, refers to a technique used in Fortran for sharing
variables between source files, using a (possibly named) COMMON block.
What happens here is that each of a number of files provides a tentative
definition of the variable.
As long as no more than one file provides an initialized definition,
then the various files end up sharing a common single definition of the
variable:</p>
<h3>file10.c</h3>
<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>#include &quot;prog2.h&quot;

long l;   /* Do not do this in portable code */

void inc(void) { l++; }
</code></pre>
<h3>file11.c</h3>
<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>#include &quot;prog2.h&quot;

long l;   /* Do not do this in portable code */

void dec(void) { l--; }
</code></pre>
<h3>file12.c</h3>
<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>#include &quot;prog2.h&quot;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

long l = 9;   /* Do not do this in portable code */

void put(void) { printf(&quot;l = %ld\n&quot;, l); }
</code></pre>
<p>This technique does not conform to the letter of the C standard and the
'one definition rule' — it is officially undefined behaviour:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href=""http://port70.net/%7Ensz/c/c11/n1570.html#J.2"" rel=""noreferrer"">J.2 Undefined behavior</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>An identifier with external linkage is used, but in the program there
does not exist exactly one external definition for the identifier, or
the identifier is not used and there exist multiple external
definitions for the identifier (6.9).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href=""http://port70.net/%7Ensz/c/c11/n1570.html#6.9p5"" rel=""noreferrer"">§6.9 External definitions ¶5</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>An <em>external definition</em> is an external declaration that is also a
definition of a function (other than an inline definition) or an
object.
If an identifier declared with external linkage is used in an
expression (other than as part of the operand of a <code>sizeof</code> or
<code>_Alignof</code> operator whose result is an integer constant), somewhere in
the entire program there shall be exactly one external definition for
the identifier; otherwise, there shall be no more than
one.<sup>161)</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>161)</sup> Thus, if an identifier declared with external linkage
is not used in an expression, there need be no external definition for
it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, the C standard also lists it in informative Annex J as one of
the <a href=""http://port70.net/%7Ensz/c/c11/n1570.html#J.5"" rel=""noreferrer"">Common extensions</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href=""http://port70.net/%7Ensz/c/c11/n1570.html#J.5.11"" rel=""noreferrer"">J.5.11 Multiple external definitions</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There may be more than one external definition for the identifier of
an object, with or without the explicit use of the keyword extern; if
the definitions disagree, or more than one is initialized, the
behavior is undefined (6.9.2).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because this technique is not always supported, it is best to avoid
using it, <em>especially if your code needs to be portable</em>.
Using this technique, you can also end up with unintentional type
punning.</p>
<p>If one of the files above declared <code>l</code> as a <code>double</code> instead of as a
<code>long</code>, C's type-unsafe linkers probably would not spot the mismatch.
If you're on a machine with 64-bit <code>long</code> and <code>double</code>, you'd not even
get a warning; on a machine with 32-bit <code>long</code> and 64-bit <code>double</code>,
you'd probably get a warning about the different sizes — the linker
would use the largest size, exactly as a Fortran program would take the
largest size of any common blocks.</p>
<p>Note that GCC 10.1.0, which was released on 2020-05-07, changes the
default compilation options to use
<a href=""https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/porting_to.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>-fno-common</code></a>, which means
that by default, the code above no longer links unless you override the
default with <code>-fcommon</code> (or use attributes, etc — see the link).</p>

<h3>Warning</h3>
<p>As noted in comments here, and as stated in my answer to a similar
<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1490693"">question</a>, using multiple
definitions for a global variable leads to undefined behaviour (J.2;
§6.9), which is the standard's way of saying &quot;anything could happen&quot;.
One of the things that can happen is that the program behaves as you
expect; and J.5.11 says, approximately, &quot;you might be lucky more often
than you deserve&quot;.
But a program that relies on multiple definitions of an extern variable
— with or without the explicit 'extern' keyword — is not a strictly
conforming program and not guaranteed to work everywhere.
Equivalently: it contains a bug which may or may not show itself.</p>
<h2>Violating the guidelines</h2>
<p>There are, of course, many ways in which these guidelines can be broken.
Occasionally, there may be a good reason to break the guidelines, but
such occasions are extremely unusual.</p>
<h3>faulty_header.h</h3>
<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>int some_var;    /* Do not do this in a header!!! */
</code></pre>
<p>Note 1: if the header defines the variable without the <code>extern</code> keyword,
then each file that includes the header creates a tentative definition
of the variable.
As noted previously, this will often work, but the C standard does not
guarantee that it will work.</p>
<h3>broken_header.h</h3>
<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>int some_var = 13;    /* Only one source file in a program can use this */
</code></pre>
<p>Note 2: if the header defines and initializes the variable, then only
one source file in a given program can use the header.
Since headers are primarily for sharing information, it is a bit silly
to create one that can only be used once.</p>
<h3>seldom_correct.h</h3>
<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>static int hidden_global = 3;   /* Each source file gets its own copy  */
</code></pre>
<p>Note 3: if the header defines a static variable (with or without
initialization), then each source file ends up with its own private
version of the 'global' variable.</p>
<p>If the variable is actually a complex array, for example, this can lead
to extreme duplication of code.  It can, very occasionally, be a
sensible way to achieve some effect, but that is very unusual.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Use the header technique I showed first.
It works reliably and everywhere.
Note, in particular, that the header declaring the <code>global_variable</code> is
included in every file that uses it — including the one that defines it.
This ensures that everything is self-consistent.</p>
<p>Similar concerns arise with declaring and defining functions —
analogous rules apply.
But the question was about variables specifically, so I've kept the
answer to variables only.</p>
<h3>End of Original Answer</h3>
<p><sup><em>If you're not an experienced C programmer, you probably should stop reading here.</em></sup></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Late Major Addition</em></p>
<h1>Avoiding Code Duplication</h1>
<p>One concern that is sometimes (and legitimately) raised about the
'declarations in headers, definitions in source' mechanism described
here is that there are two files to be kept synchronized — the header
and the source.  This is usually followed up with an observation that a
macro can be used so that the header serves double duty — normally
declaring the variables, but when a specific macro is set before the
header is included, it defines the variables instead.</p>
<p>Another concern can be that the variables need to be defined in each of
a number of 'main programs'.  This is normally a spurious concern; you
can simply introduce a C source file to define the variables and link
the object file produced with each of the programs.</p>
<p>A typical scheme works like this, using the original global variable
illustrated in <code>file3.h</code>:</p>
<h3>file3a.h</h3>
<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>#ifdef DEFINE_VARIABLES
#define EXTERN /* nothing */
#else

</code></pre>

</code></pre>
<h3>file2a.c</h3>
<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>#include &quot;file3a.h&quot;
#include &quot;prog3.h&quot;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void use_it(void)
{
    printf(&quot;Global variable: %d\n&quot;, global_variable++);
}
</code></pre>

</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Variable initialization</h2>
<p>The problem with this scheme as shown is that it does not provide for
initialization of the global variable.  With C99 or C11 and variable argument
lists for macros, you could define a macro to support initialization too.
(With C89 and no support for variable argument lists in macros, there is no
easy way to handle arbitrarily long initializers.)</p>
<h3>file3b.h</h3>
<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>#ifdef DEFINE_VARIABLES
#define EXTERN                  /* nothing */
#define INITIALIZER(...)        = __VA_ARGS__
#else
#define EXTERN                  extern
#define INITIALIZER(...)        /* nothing */
#endif /* DEFINE_VARIABLES */

EXTERN int global_variable INITIALIZER(37);
EXTERN struct { int a; int b; } oddball_struct INITIALIZER({ 41, 43 });

<h3>file1b.c</h3>
<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>#define DEFINE_VARIABLES
#include &quot;file3b.h&quot;  /* Variables now defined and initialized */
#include &quot;prog4.h&quot;

int oddball_value(void) { return oddball_struct.a + oddball_struct.b; }

    printf(&quot;Global variable: %d\n&quot;, global_variable++);
    oddball_struct.a += global_variable;
    oddball_struct.b -= global_variable / 2;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Clearly, the code for the oddball structure is not what you'd normally
write, but it illustrates the point.  The first argument to the second
invocation of <code>INITIALIZER</code> is <code>{ 41</code> and the remaining argument
(singular in this example) is <code>43 }</code>.  Without C99 or similar support
for variable argument lists for macros, initializers that need to
contain commas are very problematic.</p>

<h2>Header Guards</h2>
<p>Any header should be protected against reinclusion, so that type
definitions (enum, struct or union types, or typedefs generally) do not
cause problems.  The standard technique is to wrap the body of the
header in a header guard such as:</p>
<pre><code>#ifndef FILE3B_H_INCLUDED
#define FILE3B_H_INCLUDED

...contents of header...

#endif /* FILE3B_H_INCLUDED */
</code></pre>
<p>The header might be included twice indirectly.  For example, if
<code>file4b.h</code> includes <code>file3b.h</code> for a type definition that isn't shown,
and <code>file1b.c</code> needs to use both header <code>file4b.h</code> and <code>file3b.h</code>, then
you have some more tricky issues to resolve.  Clearly, you might revise
the header list to include just <code>file4b.h</code>.  However, you might not be
aware of the internal dependencies — and the code should, ideally,
continue to work.</p>
<p>Further, it starts to get tricky because you might include <code>file4b.h</code>
before including <code>file3b.h</code> to generate the definitions, but the normal
header guards on <code>file3b.h</code> would prevent the header being reincluded.</p>
<p>So, you need to include the body of <code>file3b.h</code> at most once for
declarations, and at most once for definitions, but you might need both
in a single translation unit (TU — a combination of a source file and
the headers it uses).</p>
<h2>Multiple inclusion with variable definitions</h2>
<p>However, it can be done subject to a not too unreasonable constraint.
Let's introduce a new set of file names:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>external.h</code> for the EXTERN macro definitions, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>file1c.h</code> to define types (notably, <code>struct oddball</code>, the type of <code>oddball_struct</code>).</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>file2c.h</code> to define or declare the global variables.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>file3c.c</code> which defines the global variables.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>file4c.c</code> which simply uses the global variables.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>file5c.c</code> which shows that you can declare and then define the global variables.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>file6c.c</code> which shows that you can define and then (attempt to) declare the global variables.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In these examples, <code>file5c.c</code> and <code>file6c.c</code> directly include the header
<code>file2c.h</code> several times, but that is the simplest way to show that the
mechanism works.  It means that if the header was indirectly included
twice, it would also be safe.</p>
<p>The restrictions for this to work are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The header defining or declaring the global variables may not itself
define any types.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Immediately before you include a header that should define variables,
you define the macro DEFINE_VARIABLES.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The header defining or declaring the variables has stylized contents.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This scheme avoids most problems.  You only run into a problem if a

another header (say <code>file7c.h</code>) that defines variables.  There isn't an
easy way around that other than &quot;don't do it&quot;.</p>
<p>You can partially work around the problem by revising <code>file2c.h</code> into
<code>file2d.h</code>:</p>

<p>in the source code (so the headers never alter the value of

<h1>Helping the compiler</h1>
<p>(summary for this case: use <code>uint64_t n</code>)</p>
<p>First of all, it's only interesting to look at optimized compiler output.  (<code>-O3</code>).<br />
<strong><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/32001196/224132""><code>-O0</code> speed is basically meaningless.</a></strong></p>
<p>Look at your asm output (on Godbolt, or see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/38552116/224132"">How to remove &quot;noise&quot; from GCC/clang assembly output?</a>).  When the compiler doesn't make optimal code in the first place: <strong>Writing your C/C++ source in a way that guides the compiler into making better code is usually the best approach</strong>.  You have to know asm, and know what's efficient, but you apply this knowledge indirectly.  Compilers are also a good source of ideas: sometimes clang will do something cool, and you can hand-hold gcc into doing the same thing: see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/34410357/224132"">this answer</a> and what I did with the non-unrolled loop in @Veedrac's code below.)</p>
<p>This approach is portable, and in 20 years some future compiler can compile it to whatever is efficient on future hardware (x86 or not), maybe using new ISA extension or auto-vectorizing.  Hand-written x86-64 asm from 15 years ago would usually not be optimally tuned for Skylake.  e.g. compare&amp;branch macro-fusion didn't exist back then.  <strong>What's optimal now for hand-crafted asm for one microarchitecture might not be optimal for other current and future CPUs.</strong>  <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40354978/why-is-this-c-code-faster-than-my-hand-written-assembly-for-testing-the-collat#comment67966852_40356449"">Comments on @johnfound's answer</a> discuss major differences between AMD Bulldozer and Intel Haswell, which have a big effect on this code.  But in theory, <code>g++ -O3 -march=bdver3</code> and <code>g++ -O3 -march=skylake</code> will do the right thing.  (Or <code>-march=native</code>.)   Or <code>-mtune=...</code> to just tune, without using instructions that other CPUs might not support.</p>
<p>My feeling is that guiding the compiler to asm that's good for a current CPU you care about shouldn't be a problem for future compilers.  They're hopefully better than current compilers at finding ways to transform code, and can find a way that works for future CPUs.  Regardless, future x86 probably won't be terrible at anything that's good on current x86, and the future compiler will avoid any asm-specific pitfalls while implementing something like the data movement from your C source, if it doesn't see something better.</p>
<p>Hand-written asm is a black-box for the optimizer, so constant-propagation doesn't work when inlining makes an input a compile-time constant.  Other optimizations are also affected.  Read <a href=""https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DontUseInlineAsm"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DontUseInlineAsm</a> before using asm.  (And avoid MSVC-style inline asm: inputs/outputs have to go through memory <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/35959859/224132"">which adds overhead</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>In this case</strong>: your <code>n</code> has a signed type, and gcc uses the SAR/SHR/ADD sequence that gives the correct rounding.  (IDIV and arithmetic-shift &quot;round&quot; differently for negative inputs, see the <a href=""http://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/SAL:SAR:SHL:SHR.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">SAR insn set ref manual entry</a>).  (IDK if gcc tried and failed to prove that <code>n</code> can't be negative, or what.  Signed-overflow is undefined behaviour, so it should have been able to.)</p>
<p>You should have used <code>uint64_t n</code>, so it can just SHR.  And so it's portable to systems where <code>long</code> is only 32-bit (e.g. x86-64 Windows).</p>
<hr />
<p>BTW, <strong>gcc's <em>optimized</em> asm output looks pretty good (using <code>unsigned long n</code>)</strong>: the inner loop it inlines into <code>main()</code> does this:</p>
<pre><code> # from gcc5.4 -O3  plus my comments

 # edx= count=1
 # rax= uint64_t n

.L9:                   # do{
    lea    rcx, [rax+1+rax*2]   # rcx = 3*n + 1
    mov    rdi, rax
    shr    rdi         # rdi = n&gt;&gt;1;
    test   al, 1       # set flags based on n%2 (aka n&amp;1)
    mov    rax, rcx
    cmove  rax, rdi    # n= (n%2) ? 3*n+1 : n/2;
    add    edx, 1      # ++count;
    cmp    rax, 1
    jne   .L9          #}while(n!=1)

  cmp/branch to update max and maxi, and then do the next n
</code></pre>
<p>The inner loop is branchless, and the critical path of the loop-carried dependency chain is:</p>
<ul>
<li>3-component LEA (3 cycles)</li>
<li>cmov (2 cycles on Haswell, 1c on Broadwell or later).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total: 5 cycle per iteration, latency bottleneck</strong>.  Out-of-order execution takes care of everything else in parallel with this (in theory: I haven't tested with perf counters to see if it really runs at 5c/iter).</p>
<p>The FLAGS input of <code>cmov</code> (produced by TEST) is faster to produce than the RAX input (from LEA-&gt;MOV), so it's not on the critical path.</p>
<p>Similarly, the MOV-&gt;SHR that produces CMOV's RDI input is off the critical path, because it's also faster than the LEA.  MOV on IvyBridge and later has zero latency (handled at register-rename time).  (It still takes a uop, and a slot in the pipeline, so it's not free, just zero latency).  The extra MOV in the LEA dep chain is part of the bottleneck on other CPUs.</p>
<p>The cmp/jne is also not part of the critical path: it's not loop-carried, because control dependencies are handled with branch prediction + speculative execution, unlike data dependencies on the critical path.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Beating the compiler</h1>
<p>GCC did a pretty good job here.  It could save one code byte by using <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/36510865/224132""><code>inc edx</code> instead of <code>add edx, 1</code></a>, because nobody cares about P4 and its false-dependencies for partial-flag-modifying instructions.</p>
<p>It could also save all the MOV instructions, and the TEST:  SHR sets CF= the bit shifted out, so we can use <code>cmovc</code> instead of <code>test</code> / <code>cmovz</code>.</p>
<pre><code> ### Hand-optimized version of what gcc does
.L9:                       #do{
    lea     rcx, [rax+1+rax*2] # rcx = 3*n + 1
    shr     rax, 1         # n&gt;&gt;=1;    CF = n&amp;1 = n%2
    cmovc   rax, rcx       # n= (n&amp;1) ? 3*n+1 : n/2;
    inc     edx            # ++count;
    cmp     rax, 1
    jne     .L9            #}while(n!=1)
</code></pre>
<p>See @johnfound's answer for another clever trick: remove the CMP by branching on SHR's flag result as well as using it for CMOV:  zero only if n was 1 (or 0) to start with.  (Fun fact: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/36510865/224132"">SHR with count != 1 on Nehalem or earlier causes a stall if you read the flag results</a>.  That's how they made it single-uop.  The shift-by-1 special encoding is fine, though.)</p>
<p>Avoiding MOV doesn't help with the latency at all on Haswell (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/44169342"">Can x86&#39;s MOV really be &quot;free&quot;? Why can&#39;t I reproduce this at all?</a>).  It does help <em>significantly</em> on CPUs like Intel pre-IvB, and AMD Bulldozer-family, where MOV is not zero-latency (and Ice Lake with updated microcode).  The compiler's wasted MOV instructions do affect the critical path.  BD's complex-LEA and CMOV are both lower latency (2c and 1c respectively), so it's a bigger fraction of the latency.  Also, throughput bottlenecks become an issue, because it only has two integer ALU pipes.  <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40354978/why-is-this-c-code-faster-than-assembly/40356449#40356449"">See @johnfound's answer</a>, where he has timing results from an AMD CPU.</p>
<p>Even on Haswell, this version may help a bit by avoiding some occasional delays where a non-critical uop steals an execution port from one on the critical path, delaying execution by 1 cycle.  (This is called a resource conflict).  It also saves a register, which may help when doing multiple <code>n</code> values in parallel in an interleaved loop (see below).</p>
<p><strong>LEA's latency depends on the addressing mode</strong>, on Intel SnB-family CPUs.  3c for 3 components (<code>[base+idx+const]</code>, which takes two separate adds), but only 1c with 2 or fewer components (one add).  Some CPUs (like Core2) do even a 3-component LEA in a single cycle, but SnB-family doesn't.  Worse, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/40212446/224132"">Intel SnB-family standardizes latencies so there are no 2c uops</a>, otherwise 3-component LEA would be only 2c like Bulldozer.  (3-component LEA is slower on AMD as well, just not by as much).</p>
<p>So <code>lea  rcx, [rax + rax*2]</code> / <code>inc rcx</code> is only 2c latency, faster than <code>lea  rcx, [rax + rax*2 + 1]</code>, on Intel SnB-family CPUs like Haswell.  Break-even on BD, and worse on Core2.  It does cost an extra uop, which normally isn't worth it to save 1c latency, but latency is the major bottleneck here and Haswell has a wide enough pipeline to handle the extra uop throughput.</p>
<p><strong>Neither gcc, icc, nor clang (on godbolt) used SHR's CF output, always using an AND or TEST</strong>.  Silly compilers. :P  They're great pieces of complex machinery, but a clever human can often beat them on small-scale problems.  (Given thousands to millions of times longer to think about it, of course!  Compilers don't use exhaustive algorithms to search for every possible way to do things, because that would take too long when optimizing a lot of inlined code, which is what they do best.  They also don't model the pipeline in the target microarchitecture, at least not in the same detail as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26021337/what-is-iaca-and-how-do-i-use-it"">IACA</a> or other static-analysis tools; they just use some heuristics.)</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Simple loop unrolling won't help</strong>; this loop bottlenecks on the latency of a loop-carried dependency chain, not on loop overhead / throughput.  This means it would do well with hyperthreading (or any other kind of SMT), since the CPU has lots of time to interleave instructions from two threads.  This would mean parallelizing the loop in <code>main</code>, but that's fine because each thread can just check a range of <code>n</code> values and produce a pair of integers as a result.</p>
<p><strong>Interleaving by hand within a single thread might be viable, too</strong>.  Maybe compute the sequence for a pair of numbers in parallel, since each one only takes a couple registers, and they can all update the same <code>max</code> / <code>maxi</code>.  This creates more <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction-level_parallelism"" rel=""noreferrer"">instruction-level parallelism</a>.</p>
<p>The trick is deciding whether to wait until all the <code>n</code> values have reached <code>1</code> before getting another pair of starting <code>n</code> values, or whether to break out and get a new start point for just one that reached the end condition, without touching the registers for the other sequence.  Probably it's best to keep each chain working on useful data, otherwise you'd have to conditionally increment its counter.</p>
<hr />
<p>You could maybe even do this with SSE packed-compare stuff to conditionally increment the counter for vector elements where <code>n</code> hadn't reached <code>1</code> yet.  And then to hide the even longer latency of a SIMD conditional-increment implementation, you'd need to keep more vectors of <code>n</code> values up in the air.  Maybe only worth with 256b vector (4x <code>uint64_t</code>).</p>
<p>I think the best strategy to make detection of a <code>1</code> &quot;sticky&quot; is to mask the vector of all-ones that you add to increment the counter.  So after you've seen a <code>1</code> in an element, the increment-vector will have a zero, and +=0 is a no-op.</p>
<h3>Untested idea for manual vectorization</h3>
<pre><code># starting with YMM0 = [ n_d, n_c, n_b, n_a ]  (64-bit elements)
# ymm4 = _mm256_set1_epi64x(1):  increment vector
# ymm5 = all-zeros:  count vector

.inner_loop:
    vpaddq    ymm1, ymm0, xmm0
    vpaddq    ymm1, ymm1, xmm0
    vpaddq    ymm1, ymm1, set1_epi64(1)     # ymm1= 3*n + 1.  Maybe could do this more efficiently?

    vpsllq    ymm3, ymm0, 63                # shift bit 1 to the sign bit

    vpsrlq    ymm0, ymm0, 1                 # n /= 2

    # FP blend between integer insns may cost extra bypass latency, but integer blends don't have 1 bit controlling a whole qword.
    vpblendvpd ymm0, ymm0, ymm1, ymm3       # variable blend controlled by the sign bit of each 64-bit element.  I might have the source operands backwards, I always have to look this up.

    # ymm0 = updated n  in each element.

    vpcmpeqq ymm1, ymm0, set1_epi64(1)
    vpandn   ymm4, ymm1, ymm4         # zero out elements of ymm4 where the compare was true

    vpaddq   ymm5, ymm5, ymm4         # count++ in elements where n has never been == 1

    vptest   ymm4, ymm4
    jnz  .inner_loop
    # Fall through when all the n values have reached 1 at some point, and our increment vector is all-zero

    vextracti128 ymm0, ymm5, 1
    vpmaxq .... crap this doesn't exist
    # Actually just delay doing a horizontal max until the very very end.  But you need some way to record max and maxi.
</code></pre>
<p>You can and should implement this with intrinsics instead of hand-written asm.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Algorithmic / implementation improvement:</h2>
<p>Besides just implementing the same logic with more efficient asm, look for ways to simplify the logic, or avoid redundant work.  e.g. memoize to detect common endings to sequences. Or even better, look at 8 trailing bits at once (gnasher's answer)</p>
<p>@EOF points out that <code>tzcnt</code> (or <code>bsf</code>) could be used to do multiple <code>n/=2</code> iterations in one step. That's probably better than SIMD vectorizing; no SSE or AVX instruction can do that. It's still compatible with doing multiple scalar <code>n</code>s in parallel in different integer registers, though.</p>
<p>So the loop might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>goto loop_entry;  // C++ structured like the asm, for illustration only
do {
   n = n*3 + 1;
  loop_entry:
   shift = _tzcnt_u64(n);
   n &gt;&gt;= shift;
   count += shift;
} while(n != 1);
</code></pre>
<p>This may do significantly fewer iterations, but variable-count shifts are slow on Intel SnB-family CPUs without BMI2. 3 uops, 2c latency.  (They have an input dependency on the FLAGS because count=0 means the flags are unmodified. They handle this as a data dependency, and take multiple uops because a uop can only have 2 inputs (pre-HSW/BDW anyway)).  This is the kind that people complaining about x86's crazy-CISC design are referring to. It makes x86 CPUs slower than they would be if the ISA was designed from scratch today, even in a mostly-similar way.  (i.e. this is part of the &quot;x86 tax&quot; that costs speed / power.) SHRX/SHLX/SARX (BMI2) are a big win (1 uop / 1c latency).</p>
<p>It also puts tzcnt (3c on Haswell and later) on the critical path, so it significantly lengthens the total latency of the loop-carried dependency chain. It does remove any need for a CMOV, or for preparing a register holding <code>n&gt;&gt;1</code>, though. <strong>@Veedrac's answer overcomes all this by deferring the tzcnt/shift for multiple iterations, which is highly effective (see below).</strong></p>
<p>We can safely use <a href=""http://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/BSF.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">BSF</a> or <a href=""http://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/TZCNT.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">TZCNT</a> interchangeably, because <code>n</code> can never be zero at that point. TZCNT's machine-code decodes as BSF on CPUs that don't support BMI1. (Meaningless prefixes are ignored, so REP BSF runs as BSF).</p>
<p>TZCNT performs much better than BSF on AMD CPUs that support it,  so it can be a good idea to use <code>REP BSF</code>, even if you don't care about setting ZF if the input is zero rather than the output.  Some compilers do this when you use <code>__builtin_ctzll</code> even with <code>-mno-bmi</code>.</p>
<p>They perform the same on Intel CPUs, so just save the byte if that's all that matters. TZCNT on Intel (pre-Skylake) still has a false-dependency on the supposedly write-only output operand, just like BSF, to support the undocumented behaviour that BSF with input = 0 leaves its destination unmodified. So you need to work around that unless optimizing only for Skylake, so there's nothing to gain from the extra REP byte. (Intel often goes above and beyond what the x86 ISA manual requires, to avoid breaking widely-used code that depends on something it shouldn't, or that is retroactively disallowed. e.g. <a href=""http://blog.stuffedcow.net/2015/08/pagewalk-coherence/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Windows 9x's assumes no speculative prefetching of TLB entries</a>, which was safe when the code was written, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17395557/observing-stale-instruction-fetching-on-x86-with-self-modifying-code#comment68191467_18388700"">before Intel updated the TLB management rules</a>.)</p>
<p>Anyway, LZCNT/TZCNT on Haswell have the same false dep as POPCNT: see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25078285/replacing-a-32-bit-loop-count-variable-with-64-bit-introduces-crazy-performance"">this Q&amp;A</a>. This is why in gcc's asm output for @Veedrac's code, you see it <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/33668295/224132"">breaking the dep chain with xor-zeroing</a> on the register it's about to use as TZCNT's destination when it doesn't use dst=src. Since TZCNT/LZCNT/POPCNT never leave their destination undefined or unmodified, this false dependency on the output on Intel CPUs is a performance bug / limitation. Presumably it's worth some transistors / power to have them behave like other uops that go to the same execution unit. The only perf upside is interaction with another uarch limitation: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26046634/micro-fusion-and-addressing-modes"">they can micro-fuse a memory operand with an indexed addressing mode</a> on Haswell, but on Skylake where Intel removed the false dep for LZCNT/TZCNT they &quot;un-laminate&quot; indexed addressing modes while POPCNT can still micro-fuse any addr mode.</p>

<h1>Improvements to ideas / code from other answers:</h1>
<p><strong>@hidefromkgb's answer</strong> has a nice observation that you're guaranteed to be able to do one right shift after a 3n+1.  You can compute this more even more efficiently than just leaving out the checks between steps.  The asm implementation in that answer is broken, though (it depends on OF, which is undefined after SHRD with a count &gt; 1), and slow: <code>ROR rdi,2</code> is faster than <code>SHRD rdi,rdi,2</code>, and using two CMOV instructions on the critical path is slower than an extra TEST that can run in parallel.</p>
<p>I put tidied / improved C (which guides the compiler to produce better asm), and tested+working faster asm (in comments below the C) up on Godbolt: see the link in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40354978/why-is-this-c-code-faster-than-my-hand-written-assembly-for-testing-the-collat/40367384#40367384"">@hidefromkgb's answer</a>.  (This answer hit the 30k char limit from the large Godbolt URLs, but <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/319549/how-are-we-supposed-to-post-godbolt-links-now-that-url-shortening-is-blocked/319594#319594"">shortlinks can rot</a> and were too long for goo.gl anyway.)</p>
<p>Also improved the output-printing to convert to a string and make one <code>write()</code> instead of writing one char at a time. This minimizes impact on timing the whole program with <code>perf stat ./collatz</code> (to record performance counters), and I de-obfuscated some of the non-critical asm.</p>

<h2>How to iterate over rows in a DataFrame in Pandas</h2>
</blockquote>
<h1>Answer: DON'T<sup>*</sup>!</h1>
<p>Iteration in Pandas is an anti-pattern and is something you should only do when you have exhausted every other option. You should not use any function with &quot;<code>iter</code>&quot; in its name for more than a few thousand rows or you will have to get used to a <strong>lot</strong> of waiting.</p>
<p>Do you want to print a DataFrame? Use <a href=""https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_string.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong><code>DataFrame.to_string()</code></strong></a>.</p>
<p>Do you want to compute something? In that case, search for methods in this order (list modified from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24870953/does-iterrows-have-performance-issues"">here</a>):</p>
<ol>
<li>Vectorization</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cython"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cython</a> routines</li>
<li>List Comprehensions (vanilla <code>for</code> loop)</li>

</ol>
<p><code>iterrows</code> and <code>itertuples</code> (both receiving many votes in answers to this question) should be used in very rare circumstances, such as generating row objects/nametuples for sequential processing, which is really the only thing these functions are useful for.</p>
<p><strong>Appeal to Authority</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/basics.html#iteration"" rel=""noreferrer"">The documentation page</a> on iteration has a huge red warning box that says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iterating through pandas objects is generally slow. In many cases, iterating manually over the rows is not needed [...].</p>
</blockquote>
<p><sub>* It's actually a little more complicated than &quot;don't&quot;. <code>df.iterrows()</code> is the correct answer to this question, but &quot;vectorize your ops&quot; is the better one. I will concede that there are circumstances where iteration cannot be avoided (for example, some operations where the result depends on the value computed for the previous row). However, it takes some familiarity with the library to know when. If you're not sure whether you need an iterative solution, you probably don't.

<h2>Faster than Looping: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1422149/what-is-vectorization"">Vectorization</a>, <a href=""https://cython.org"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cython</a></h2>
<p>A good number of basic operations and computations are &quot;vectorised&quot; by pandas (either through NumPy, or through Cythonized functions). This includes arithmetic, comparisons, (most) reductions, reshaping (such as pivoting), joins, and groupby operations. Look through the documentation on <a href=""https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/basics.html#essential-basic-functionality"" rel=""noreferrer"">Essential Basic Functionality</a> to find a suitable vectorised method for your problem.</p>
<p>If none exists, feel free to write your own using custom <a href=""https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/enhancingperf.html#cython-writing-c-extensions-for-pandas"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cython extensions</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Next Best Thing: <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions"" rel=""noreferrer"">List Comprehensions</a><sup>*</sup></h2>
<p>List comprehensions should be your next port of call if 1) there is no vectorized solution available, 2) performance is important, but not important enough to go through the hassle of cythonizing your code, and 3) you're trying to perform elementwise transformation on your code. There is a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54028199/for-loops-with-pandas-when-should-i-care"">good amount of evidence</a> to suggest that list comprehensions are sufficiently fast (and even sometimes faster) for many common Pandas tasks.</p>
<p>The formula is simple,</p>
<pre><code># Iterating over one column - `f` is some function that processes your data
result = [f(x) for x in df['col']]
# Iterating over two columns, use `zip`
result = [f(x, y) for x, y in zip(df['col1'], df['col2'])]
# Iterating over multiple columns - same data type
result = [f(row[0], ..., row[n]) for row in df[['col1', ...,'coln']].to_numpy()]
# Iterating over multiple columns - differing data type
result = [f(row[0], ..., row[n]) for row in zip(df['col1'], ..., df['coln'])]
</code></pre>
<p>If you can encapsulate your business logic into a function, you can use a list comprehension that calls it. You can make arbitrarily complex things work through the simplicity and speed of raw Python code.</p>
<p><strong>Caveats</strong></p>
<p>List comprehensions assume that your data is easy to work with - what that means is your data types are consistent and you don't have NaNs, but this cannot always be guaranteed.</p>
<ol>
<li>The first one is more obvious, but when dealing with NaNs, prefer in-built pandas methods if they exist (because they have much better corner-case handling logic), or ensure your business logic includes appropriate NaN handling logic.</li>
<li>When dealing with mixed data types you should iterate over <code>zip(df['A'], df['B'], ...)</code> instead of <code>df[['A', 'B']].to_numpy()</code> as the latter implicitly upcasts data to the most common type. As an example if A is numeric and B is string, <code>to_numpy()</code> will cast the entire array to string, which may not be what you want. Fortunately <code>zip</code>ping your columns together is the most straightforward workaround to this.</li>
</ol>
<p><sub>*Your mileage may vary for the reasons outlined in the <strong>Caveats</strong> section above.</sub></p>
<hr />
<h2>An Obvious Example</h2>
<p>Let's demonstrate the difference with a simple example of adding two pandas columns <code>A + B</code>. This is a vectorizable operation, so it will be easy to contrast the performance of the methods discussed above.</p>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/y44RJ.png"" width=""600"" />
<p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/Coldsp33d/948f96b384ca5bdf6e8ce203ac97c9a0"" rel=""noreferrer"">Benchmarking code, for your reference</a>. The line at the bottom measures a function written in numpandas, a style of Pandas that mixes heavily with NumPy to squeeze out maximum performance. Writing numpandas code should be avoided unless you know what you're doing. Stick to the API where you can (i.e., prefer <code>vec</code> over <code>vec_numpy</code>).</p>
<p>I should mention, however, that it isn't always this cut and dry. Sometimes the answer to &quot;what is the best method for an operation&quot; is &quot;it depends on your data&quot;. My advice is to test out different approaches on your data before settling on one.</p>
<hr />
<h2>My Personal Opinion <sup>*</sup></h2>
<p>Most of the analyses performed on the various alternatives to the iter family has been through the lens of performance. However, in most situations you will typically be working on a reasonably sized dataset (nothing beyond a few thousand or 100K rows) and performance will come second to simplicity/readability of the solution.</p>
<p>Here is my personal preference when selecting a method to use for a problem.</p>
<p>For the novice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Vectorization</em> (when possible)<em>; <code>apply()</code>; List Comprehensions; <code>itertuples()</code>/<code>iteritems()</code>; <code>iterrows()</code>; Cython</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the more experienced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Vectorization</em> (when possible)<em>; <code>apply()</code>; List Comprehensions; Cython; <code>itertuples()</code>/<code>iteritems()</code>; <code>iterrows()</code></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vectorization prevails as the most idiomatic method for any problem that can be vectorized. Always seek to vectorize! When in doubt, consult the docs, or look on Stack Overflow for an existing question on your particular task.</p>
<p>I do tend to go on about how bad <code>apply</code> is in a lot of my posts, but I do concede it is easier for a beginner to wrap their head around what it's doing. Additionally, there are quite a few use cases for <code>apply</code> has explained in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54432583/when-should-i-not-want-to-use-pandas-apply-in-my-code"">this post of mine</a>.</p>
<p>Cython ranks lower down on the list because it takes more time and effort to pull off correctly. You will usually never need to write code with pandas that demands this level of performance that even a list comprehension cannot satisfy.</p>
<p><sub>* As with any personal opinion, please take with heaps of salt!</sub></p>

<h2>Why I Wrote this Answer</h2>
<p>A common trend I notice from new users is to ask questions of the form &quot;How can I iterate over my df to do X?&quot;. Showing code that calls <code>iterrows()</code> while doing something inside a <code>for</code> loop. Here is why. A new user to the library who has not been introduced to the concept of vectorization will likely envision the code that solves their problem as iterating over their data to do something. Not knowing how to iterate over a DataFrame, the first thing they do is Google it and end up here, at this question. They then see the accepted answer telling them how to, and they close their eyes and run this code without ever first questioning if iteration is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>The aim of this answer is to help new users understand that iteration is not necessarily the solution to every problem, and that better, faster and more idiomatic solutions could exist, and that it is worth investing time in exploring them. I'm not trying to start a war of iteration vs. vectorization, but I want new users to be informed when developing solutions to their problems with this library.</p>

3180202,2,,3177733,7/5/2010 14:19,,2018,,"<p>The use of <em>scriptlets</em> (those <code>&lt;% %&gt;</code> things) in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/jsp/info"">JSP</a> is indeed highly discouraged since the birth of <em>taglibs</em> (like <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/jstl/info"">JSTL</a>) and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/el/info"">EL</a> (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/el/info"">Expression Language</a>, those <code>${}</code> things) way back in 2001.</p>
<p>The major disadvantages of <em>scriptlets</em> are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reusability:</strong> you can't reuse scriptlets.</li>
<li><strong>Replaceability:</strong> you can't make scriptlets abstract.</li>
<li><strong>OO-ability:</strong> you can't make use of inheritance/composition.</li>
<li><strong>Debuggability:</strong> if scriptlet throws an exception halfway, all you get is a blank page.</li>
<li><strong>Testability:</strong> scriptlets are not unit-testable.</li>
<li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> per saldo more time is needed to maintain mingled/cluttered/duplicated code logic.</li>
</ol>
<p><strike>Sun</strike> Oracle itself also recommends in the <a href=""https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/javase/code-convention.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">JSP coding conventions</a> to avoid use of <em>scriptlets</em> whenever the same functionality is possible by (tag) classes. Here are several cites of relevance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From JSP 1.2 Specification, it is highly recommended that the JSP Standard Tag Library  (JSTL) be used in your web application to help <strong>reduce the need for JSP scriptlets</strong> in your pages. Pages that use JSTL are, in general, easier to read and maintain.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Where possible, <strong>avoid JSP scriptlets</strong> whenever tag libraries provide equivalent functionality. This makes pages easier to read and maintain, helps to separate business logic from presentation logic, and will make your pages easier to evolve into JSP 2.0-style pages (JSP 2.0 Specification supports but de-emphasizes the use of scriptlets).</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>In the spirit of adopting the model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern to reduce coupling between the presentation tier from the business logic, <strong>JSP scriptlets should not be used</strong> for writing business logic. Rather, JSP scriptlets are used if necessary to transform data (also called &quot;value objects&quot;) returned from processing the client's requests into a proper client-ready format. Even then, this would be better done with a front controller servlet or a custom tag.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><strong>How to replace <em>scriptlets</em> entirely depends on the sole purpose of the code/logic. More than often this code is to be placed in a fullworthy Java class:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you want to invoke the <strong>same</strong> Java code on <em>every</em> request, less-or-more regardless of the requested page, e.g. checking if a user is logged in, then implement a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/servlet-filters/info"">filter</a> and write code accordingly in <a href=""https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/9/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/filter#doFilter-jakarta.servlet.ServletRequest-jakarta.servlet.ServletResponse-jakarta.servlet.FilterChain-"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>doFilter()</code></a> method. E.g.:</p>
  <pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>  public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) throws ServletException, IOException {
      if (((HttpServletRequest) request).getSession().getAttribute(&quot;user&quot;) == null) {
          ((HttpServletResponse) response).sendRedirect(&quot;login&quot;); // Not logged in, redirect to login page.
      } else {
          chain.doFilter(request, response); // Logged in, just continue request.
      }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>When mapped on an appropriate <code>&lt;url-pattern&gt;</code> covering the JSP pages of interest, then you don't need to copypaste the same piece of code overall JSP pages.</p>
<hr />
</li>
<li><p>If you want to invoke some Java code to <strong>process a GET request</strong>, e.g. preloading some list from a database to display in some table, if necessary based on some query parameters, then implement a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/servlets/info"">servlet</a> and write code accordingly in <a href=""https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/9/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/http/httpservlet#doGet-jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest-jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse-"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>doGet()</code></a> method. E.g.:</p>
  <pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>  protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
      try {
          List&lt;Product&gt; products = productService.list(); // Obtain all products.
          request.setAttribute(&quot;products&quot;, products); // Store products in request scope.
          request.getRequestDispatcher(&quot;/WEB-INF/products.jsp&quot;).forward(request, response); // Forward to JSP page to display them in a HTML table.
      } catch (SQLException e) {
          throw new ServletException(&quot;Retrieving products failed!&quot;, e);
      }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>This way dealing with exceptions is easier. The DB is not accessed in the midst of JSP rendering, but far before the JSP is been displayed. You still have the possibility to change the response whenever the DB access throws an exception. In the above example, the default error 500 page will be displayed which you can anyway customize by an <code>&lt;error-page&gt;</code> in <code>web.xml</code>.</p>
<hr />
</li>
<li><p>If you want to invoke some Java code to <strong>process a POST request</strong>, such as gathering data from a submitted HTML form and doing some business stuff with it (conversion, validation, saving in DB, etcetera), then implement a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/servlets/info"">servlet</a> and write code accordingly in <a href=""https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/9/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/http/httpservlet#doPost-jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest-jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse-"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>doPost()</code></a> method. E.g.:</p>
  <pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>  protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
      String username = request.getParameter(&quot;username&quot;);
      String password = request.getParameter(&quot;password&quot;);
      User user = userService.find(username, password);

      if (user != null) {
          request.getSession().setAttribute(&quot;user&quot;, user); // Login user.
          response.sendRedirect(&quot;home&quot;); // Redirect to home page.
      } else {
          request.setAttribute(&quot;message&quot;, &quot;Unknown username/password. Please retry.&quot;); // Store error message in request scope.
          request.getRequestDispatcher(&quot;/WEB-INF/login.jsp&quot;).forward(request, response); // Forward to JSP page to redisplay login form with error.
      }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>This way dealing with different result page destinations is easier: redisplaying the form with validation errors in case of an error (in this particular example you can redisplay it using <code>${message}</code> in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/el/info"">EL</a>), or just taking to the desired target page in case of success.</p>
<hr />
</li>
<li><p>If you want to invoke some Java code to <strong>control</strong> the execution plan and/or the destination of the request and the response, then implement a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/servlets/info"">servlet</a> according to the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3541077/design-patterns-web-based-applications/3542297#3542297"">MVC's Front Controller Pattern</a>. E.g.:</p>
  <pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>  protected void service(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
      try {
          Action action = ActionFactory.getAction(request);
          String view = action.execute(request, response);

          if (view.equals(request.getPathInfo().substring(1)) {
              request.getRequestDispatcher(&quot;/WEB-INF/&quot; + view + &quot;.jsp&quot;).forward(request, response);
          } else {
              response.sendRedirect(view);
          }
      } catch (Exception e) {
          throw new ServletException(&quot;Executing action failed.&quot;, e);
      }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>Or just adopt an MVC framework like <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/jsf/info"">JSF</a>, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/spring-mvc/info"">Spring MVC</a>, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/wicket/info"">Wicket</a>, etc so that you end up with just a JSP/Facelets page and a JavaBean class without the need for a custom servlet.</p>
<hr />
</li>
<li><p>If you want to invoke some Java code to <strong>control the flow</strong> inside a JSP page, then you need to grab an (existing) flow control taglib like <a href=""https://jakarta.ee/specifications/tags/1.2/tagdocs/c/tld-summary.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">JSTL core</a>. E.g. displaying <code>List&lt;Product&gt;</code> in a table:</p>
  <pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>  &lt;%@ taglib uri=&quot;http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core&quot; prefix=&quot;c&quot; %&gt;
  ...
  &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;c:forEach items=&quot;${products}&quot; var=&quot;product&quot;&gt;
          &lt;tr&gt;
              &lt;td&gt;${product.name}&lt;/td&gt;
              &lt;td&gt;${product.description}&lt;/td&gt;
              &lt;td&gt;${product.price}&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/c:forEach&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>With XML-style tags which fit nicely among all that HTML, the code is better readable (and thus better maintainable) than a bunch of scriptlets with various opening and closing braces (<em>&quot;Where the heck does this closing brace belong to?&quot;</em>). An easy aid is to configure your web application to throw an exception whenever <em>scriptlets</em> are still been used by adding the following piece to <code>web.xml</code>:</p>
  <pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>  &lt;jsp-config&gt;
      &lt;jsp-property-group&gt;
          &lt;url-pattern&gt;*.jsp&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
          &lt;scripting-invalid&gt;true&lt;/scripting-invalid&gt;
      &lt;/jsp-property-group&gt;
  &lt;/jsp-config&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/facelets/info"">Facelets</a>, the successor of JSP, which is part of the Java EE provided MVC framework <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/jsf/info"">JSF</a>, it is already <strong>not</strong> possible to use <em>scriptlets</em>. This way you're automatically forced to do things &quot;the right way&quot;.</p>
<hr />
</li>
<li><p>If you want to invoke some Java code to <strong>access and display</strong> &quot;backend&quot; data inside a JSP page, then you need to use EL (Expression Language), those <code>${}</code> things. E.g. redisplaying submitted input values:</p>
  <pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;foo&quot; value=&quot;${param.foo}&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>${param.foo}</code> displays the outcome of <code>request.getParameter(&quot;foo&quot;)</code>.</p>
<hr />
</li>
<li><p>If you want to invoke some <strong>utility</strong> Java code directly in the JSP page (typically <code>public static</code> methods), then you need to define them as EL functions. There's a standard <a href=""https://jakarta.ee/specifications/tags/1.2/tagdocs/fn/tld-summary.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">functions taglib</a> in JSTL, but <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6395621/how-to-call-a-static-method-in-jsp-el"">you can also easily create functions yourself</a>. Here's an example how JSTL <code>fn:escapeXml</code> is useful to prevent <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting"" rel=""noreferrer"">XSS attacks</a>.</p>
  <pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>  &lt;%@ taglib uri=&quot;http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/functions&quot; prefix=&quot;fn&quot; %&gt;
  ...
  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;foo&quot; value=&quot;${fn:escapeXml(param.foo)}&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the XSS sensitivity is in no way specifically related to Java/JSP/JSTL/EL/whatever, this problem needs to be taken into account in <strong>every</strong> web application you develop. The problem of <em>scriptlets</em> is that it provides no way of builtin preventions, at least not using the standard Java API. JSP's successor Facelets has already implicit HTML escaping, so you don't need to worry about XSS holes in Facelets.</p>

    p =&gt; p.car,
    (key, g) =&gt; new { PersonId = key, Cars = g.ToList() });

<p>I prefer using one of the <a href=""https://php.net/manual/en/refs.xml.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">native XML extensions</a> since they come bundled with PHP, are usually faster than all the 3rd party libs and give me all the control I need over the markup.</p>
<h3><a href=""https://php.net/manual/en/book.dom.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">DOM</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The DOM extension allows you to operate on XML documents through the DOM API with PHP 5. It is an implementation of the W3C's Document Object Model Core Level 3, a platform- and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure and style of documents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DOM is capable of parsing and modifying real world (broken) HTML and it can do <a href=""http://schlitt.info/opensource/blog/0704_xpath.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">XPath queries</a>. It is based on <a href=""http://xmlsoft.org/html/libxml-HTMLparser.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">libxml</a>.</p>
<p>It takes some time to get productive with DOM, but that time is well worth it IMO. Since DOM is a language-agnostic interface, you'll find implementations in many languages, so if you need to change your programming language, chances are you will already know how to use that language's DOM API then.</p>
<p>How to use the DOM extension has been <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=DOM+HTML+%5BPHP%5D&amp;submit=search"">covered extensively</a> on StackOverflow, so if you choose to use it, you can be sure most of the issues you run into can be solved by searching/browsing Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>A <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/3820783"">basic usage example</a> and a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/4983721"">general conceptual overview</a> are available in other answers.</p>
<h3><a href=""https://php.net/manual/en/book.xmlreader.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">XMLReader</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The XMLReader extension is an XML pull parser. The reader acts as a cursor going forward on the document stream and stopping at each node on the way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>XMLReader, like DOM, is based on libxml. I am not aware of how to trigger the HTML Parser Module, so chances are using XMLReader for parsing broken HTML might be less robust than using DOM where you can explicitly tell it to use libxml's HTML Parser Module.</p>
<p>A <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/3299140"">basic usage example</a> is available in another answer.</p>
<h3><a href=""https://php.net/manual/en/book.xml.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">XML Parser</a></h3>

</blockquote>
<p>The XML Parser library is also based on libxml, and implements a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_API_for_XML"" rel=""noreferrer"">SAX</a> style XML push parser.

<h2>3rd-Party (not libxml-based)</h2>
<p>The benefit of building upon DOM/libxml is that you get good performance out of the box because you are based on a native extension. However, not all 3rd-party libs go down this route. Some of them listed below</p>
<h3><a href=""https://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.io/docs/1.9/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An HTML DOM parser written in PHP5+ lets you manipulate HTML in a very easy way!</li>
<li>Require PHP 5+.</li>
<li>Supports invalid HTML.</li>
<li>Find tags on an HTML page with selectors just like jQuery.</li>
<li>Extract contents from HTML in a single line.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I generally do not recommend this parser. The codebase is horrible and the parser itself is rather slow and memory hungry. Not all jQuery Selectors (such as <a href=""https://api.jquery.com/child-selector/"" rel=""noreferrer"">child selectors</a>) are possible. Any of the libxml based libraries should outperform this easily.</p>
<h3><a href=""https://github.com/paquettg/php-html-parser"" rel=""noreferrer"">PHP Html Parser</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>PHPHtmlParser is a simple, flexible, html parser which allows you to select tags using any css selector, like jQuery. The goal is to assiste in the development of tools which require a quick, easy way to scrape html, whether it's valid or not! This project was original supported by sunra/php-simple-html-dom-parser but the support seems to have stopped so this project is my adaptation of his previous work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, I would not recommend this parser. It is rather slow with high CPU usage. There is also no function to clear memory of created DOM objects. These problems scale particularly with nested loops. The documentation itself is inaccurate and misspelled, with no responses to fixes since 14 Apr 16.</p>
<hr />
<h2>HTML 5</h2>
<p>You can use the above for parsing HTML5, but <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/4029341"">there can be quirks</a> due to the markup HTML5 allows. So for HTML5 you may want to consider using a dedicated parser. Note that these are written in PHP, so suffer from slower performance and increased memory usage compared to a compiled extension in a lower-level language.</p>
<h3><a href=""https://github.com/ivopetkov/html5-dom-document-php/"" rel=""noreferrer"">HTML5DomDocument</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>HTML5DOMDocument extends the native DOMDocument library. It fixes some bugs and adds some new functionality.</p>

<h2>Regular Expressions</h2>
<p>Last and <strong>least recommended</strong>, you can extract data from HTML with <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=regular%20expression%20tutorials"">regular expressions</a>. In general using Regular Expressions on HTML is discouraged.</p>
<p>Most of the snippets you will find on the web to match markup are brittle. In most cases they are only working for a very particular piece of HTML. Tiny markup changes, like adding whitespace somewhere, or adding, or changing attributes in a tag, can make the RegEx fails when it's not properly written. You should know what you are doing before using RegEx on HTML.</p>
<p>HTML parsers already know the syntactical rules of HTML. Regular expressions have to be taught for each new RegEx you write. RegEx are fine in some cases, but it really depends on your use-case.</p>
<p>You <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/4234491"">can write more reliable parsers</a>, but writing a <em>complete and reliable</em> custom parser with regular expressions is a waste of time when the aforementioned libraries already exist and do a much better job on this.</p>

<p>A <code>Promise</code> handles a <strong>single event</strong> when an async operation completes or fails.</p>
<p>Note: There are <code>Promise</code> libraries out there that support cancellation, but ES6 <code>Promise</code> doesn't so far.</p>
<p><strong>Observable</strong></p>
<p>An <code>Observable</code> is like a <strong><code>Stream</code></strong> (in many languages) and allows to pass zero or more events where the callback is called for each event.</p>
<p>Often <code>Observable</code> is preferred over <code>Promise</code> because it provides the features of <code>Promise</code> and more. With <code>Observable</code> it doesn't matter if you want to handle 0, 1, or multiple events. You can utilize the same API in each case.</p>
<p><code>Observable</code> also has the advantage over <code>Promise</code> to be <strong>cancellable</strong>. If the result of an HTTP request to a server or some other expensive async operation isn't needed anymore, the <code>Subscription</code> of an <code>Observable</code> allows to cancel the subscription, while a <code>Promise</code> will eventually call the success or failed callback even when you don't need the notification or the result it provides anymore.</p>
<p>While a <code>Promise</code> starts immediately, an <code>Observable</code> only starts if you subscribe to it. This is why Observables are called lazy.</p>
<p>Observable provides <strong>operators</strong> like <code>map</code>, <code>forEach</code>, <code>reduce</code>, ... similar to an array</p>
<p>There are also powerful operators like <code>retry()</code>, or <code>replay()</code>, ... that are often quite handy.

3106909,2,,3106452,6/24/2010 2:41,,1930,,"<h2><code>ServletContext</code></h2>
<p>When the servlet container (like <a href=""http://tomcat.apache.org"" rel=""noreferrer"">Apache Tomcat</a>) starts up, it will deploy and load all its web applications. When a web application is loaded, the servlet container creates the <a href=""https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/ServletContext.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ServletContext</code></a> once and keeps it in the server's memory. The web app's <code>web.xml</code> and all of included <code>web-fragment.xml</code> files is parsed, and each <code>&lt;servlet&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;filter&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;listener&gt;</code> found (or each class annotated with <code>@WebServlet</code>, <code>@WebFilter</code> and <code>@WebListener</code> respectively) will be instantiated once and be kept in the server's memory as well, registred via the <code>ServletContext</code>. For each instantiated filter, its <code>init()</code> method is invoked with a new <a href=""https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/FilterConfig.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>FilterConfig</code></a> argument which in turn contains the involved <code>ServletContext</code>.</p>
<p>When a <code>Servlet</code> has a <code>&lt;servlet&gt;&lt;load-on-startup&gt;</code> or <code>@WebServlet(loadOnStartup)</code> value greater than <code>0</code>, then its <code>init()</code> method is also invoked during startup with a new <a href=""https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/ServletConfig.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ServletConfig</code></a> argument which in turn contains the involved <code>ServletContext</code>. Those servlets are initialized in the same order specified by that value (<code>1</code> is 1st, <code>2</code> is 2nd, etc). If the same value is specified for more than one servlet, then each of those servlets is loaded in the same order as they appear in the <code>web.xml</code>, <code>web-fragment.xml</code>, or <code>@WebServlet</code> classloading. In the event the &quot;load-on-startup&quot; value is absent, the <code>init()</code> method will be invoked whenever the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_message"" rel=""noreferrer"">HTTP request</a> hits that servlet for the very first time.</p>
<p>When the servlet container is finished with all of the above described initialization steps, then the <a href=""https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/ServletContextListener.html#contextInitialized-javax.servlet.ServletContextEvent-"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ServletContextListener#contextInitialized()</code></a> will be invoked with a <code>ServletContextEvent</code> argument which in turn contains the involved <code>ServletContext</code>. This will allow the developer the opportunity to programmatically register yet another <code>Servlet</code>, <code>Filter</code> or <code>Listener</code>.</p>
<p>When the servlet container shuts down, it unloads all web applications, invokes the <code>destroy()</code> method of all its initialized servlets and filters, and all <code>Servlet</code>, <code>Filter</code> and <code>Listener</code> instances registered via the <code>ServletContext</code> are trashed. Finally the <a href=""https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/ServletContextListener.html#contextDestroyed-javax.servlet.ServletContextEvent-"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ServletContextListener#contextDestroyed()</code></a> will be invoked and the <code>ServletContext</code> itself will be trashed.</p>
<h2><code>HttpServletRequest</code> and <code>HttpServletResponse</code></h2>
<p>The servlet container is attached to a web server that listens for HTTP requests on a certain port number (port 8080 is usually used during development and port 80 in production). When a client (e.g. user with a web browser, or <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2793150/how-to-use-java-net-urlconnection-to-fire-and-handle-http-requests"">programmatically using <code>URLConnection</code></a>) sends an HTTP request, the servlet container creates new <a href=""https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>HttpServletRequest</code></a> and <a href=""https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletResponse.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>HttpServletResponse</code></a> objects and passes them through any defined <code>Filter</code> in the chain and, eventually, the <code>Servlet</code> instance.</p>
<p>In the case of <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/servlet-filters/info"">filters</a>, the <code>doFilter()</code> method is invoked. When the servlet container's code calls <code>chain.doFilter(request, response)</code>, the request and response continue on to the next filter, or hit the servlet if there are no remaining filters.</p>
<p>In the case of <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/servlets/info"">servlets</a>, the <code>service()</code> method is invoked. By default, this method determines which one of the <code>doXxx()</code> methods to invoke based off of  <code>request.getMethod()</code>. If the determined method is absent from the servlet, then an HTTP 405 error is returned in the response.</p>
<p>The request object provides access to all of the information about the HTTP request, such as its <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL"" rel=""noreferrer"">URL</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields"" rel=""noreferrer"">headers</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string"" rel=""noreferrer"">query string</a> and body. The response object provides the ability to control and send the HTTP response the way you want by, for instance, allowing you to set the headers and the body (usually with generated HTML content from a JSP file). When the HTTP response is committed and finished, both the request and response objects are recycled and made available for reuse.</p>
<h2><code>HttpSession</code></h2>
<p>When a client visits the webapp for the first time and/or the <a href=""https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/http/HttpSession.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>HttpSession</code></a> is obtained for the first time via <code>request.getSession()</code>, the servlet container creates a new <code>HttpSession</code> object, generates a long and unique ID (which you can get by <code>session.getId()</code>), and stores it in the server's memory. The servlet container also sets a <a href=""https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/http/Cookie.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Cookie</code></a> in the <code>Set-Cookie</code> header of the HTTP response with <code>JSESSIONID</code> as its name and the unique session ID as its value.</p>
<p>As per the <a href=""http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2965.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">HTTP cookie specification</a> (a contract any decent web browser and web server must adhere to), the client (the web browser) is required to send this <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie"" rel=""noreferrer"">cookie</a> back in subsequent requests in the <code>Cookie</code> header for as long as the cookie is valid (i.e. the unique ID must refer to an unexpired session and the domain and path are correct). Using your browser's built-in HTTP traffic monitor, you can verify that the cookie is valid (press F12 in Chrome / Firefox 23+ / IE9+, and check the <em>Net/Network</em> tab). The servlet container will check the <code>Cookie</code> header of every incoming HTTP request for the presence of the cookie with the name <code>JSESSIONID</code> and use its value (the session ID) to get the associated <code>HttpSession</code> from server's memory.</p>
<p>The <code>HttpSession</code> stays alive until it has been idle (i.e. not used in a request) for more than the timeout value specified in <code>&lt;session-timeout&gt;</code>, a setting in <code>web.xml</code>. The timeout value defaults to 30 minutes. So, when the client doesn't visit the web app for longer than the time specified, the servlet container trashes the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#HTTP_session"" rel=""noreferrer"">session</a>. Every subsequent request, even with the cookie specified, will not have access to the same session anymore; the servlet container will create a new session.</p>
<p>On the client side, the session cookie stays alive for as long as the browser instance is running. So, if the client closes the browser instance (all tabs/windows), then the session is trashed on the client's side. In a new browser instance, the cookie associated with the session wouldn't exist, so it would no longer be sent. This causes an entirely new <code>HttpSession</code> to be created, with an entirely new session cookie being used.</p>
<h2>In a nutshell</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <code>ServletContext</code> lives for as long as the web app lives. It is shared among <em>all</em> requests in <em>all</em> sessions.</li>
<li>The <code>HttpSession</code> lives for as long as the client is interacting with the web app with the same browser instance, and the session hasn't timed out at the server side. It is shared among <em>all</em> requests in the <em>same</em> session.</li>
<li>The <code>HttpServletRequest</code> and <code>HttpServletResponse</code> live from the time the servlet receives an HTTP request from the client, until the complete response (the web page) has arrived. It is <em>not</em> shared elsewhere.</li>
<li>All <code>Servlet</code>, <code>Filter</code> and <code>Listener</code> instances live as long as the web app lives. They are shared among <em>all</em> requests in <em>all</em> sessions.</li>
<li>Any <code>attribute</code> that is defined in <code>ServletContext</code>, <code>HttpServletRequest</code> and <code>HttpSession</code> will live as long as the object in question lives. The object itself represents the &quot;scope&quot; in bean management frameworks such as JSF, CDI, Spring, etc. Those frameworks store their scoped beans as an <code>attribute</code> of its closest matching scope.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thread Safety</h2>
<p>That said, your major concern is possibly <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_safety"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>thread safety</em></a>. You should now know that servlets and filters are shared among all requests. That's the nice thing about Java, it's multithreaded and different threads (read: HTTP requests) can make use of the same instance. It would otherwise be too expensive to recreate, <code>init()</code> and <code>destroy()</code> them for every single request.</p>
<p>You should also realize that you should <strong>never</strong> assign any request or session scoped data as an <em>instance</em> variable of a servlet or filter. It will be shared among all other requests in other sessions. That's <strong>not</strong> thread-safe! The below example illustrates this:</p>
<pre><code>public class ExampleServlet extends HttpServlet {

    private Object thisIsNOTThreadSafe;

    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        Object thisIsThreadSafe;

        thisIsNOTThreadSafe = request.getParameter(&quot;foo&quot;); // BAD!! Shared among all requests!
        thisIsThreadSafe = request.getParameter(&quot;foo&quot;); // OK, this is thread safe.
    } 
}
</code></pre>

4526286,2,,4526273,12/24/2010 12:21,,1918,,"<p>When you make a POST request, you have to encode the data that forms the body of the request in some way.</p>
<p>HTML forms provide <a href=""https://www.w3.org/html/wg/spec/association-of-controls-and-forms.html#attr-fs-enctype"" rel=""noreferrer"">three methods of encoding</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> (the default)</li>
<li><code>multipart/form-data</code></li>
<li><code>text/plain</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Work was being done on adding <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/html-json-forms/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>application/json</code></a>, but that has been abandoned.</p>
<p>(Other encodings are possible with HTTP requests generated using other means than an HTML form submission. JSON is a common format for use with web services and some still use SOAP.)</p>
<p>The specifics of the formats don't matter to most developers. The important points are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never use <code>text/plain</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are writing client-side code:</p>
<ul>
<li>use <code>multipart/form-data</code> when your form includes any <code>&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt;</code> elements</li>
<li>otherwise you can use <code>multipart/form-data</code> or <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> but <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> will be more efficient</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are writing server-side code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a prewritten form handling library</li>
</ul>
<p>Most (such as Perl's <code>CGI-&gt;param</code> or the one exposed by PHP's <code>$_POST</code> superglobal) will take care of the differences for you. Don't bother trying to parse the raw input received by the server.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will find a library that can't handle both formats.  Node.js's most popular library for handling form data is <a href=""https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser"" rel=""noreferrer"">body-parser</a> which cannot handle multipart requests (but has documentation that recommends some alternatives which can).</p>
<hr />
<p>If you are writing (or debugging) a library for parsing or generating the raw data, then you need to start worrying about the format. You might also want to know about it for interest's sake.</p>
<p><code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> is more or less the same as a query string on the end of the URL.</p>
<p><code>multipart/form-data</code> is significantly more complicated but it allows entire files to be included in the data. An example of the result can be found in the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4"" rel=""noreferrer"">HTML 4 specification</a>.</p>
<p><code>text/plain</code> is introduced by HTML 5 and is useful only for debugging — from <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#text/plain-encoding-algorithm"" rel=""noreferrer"">the spec</a>: <em>They are not reliably interpretable by computer</em> — and I'd argue that the others combined with tools (like <a href=""https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network"" rel=""noreferrer"">the Network Panel</a> in the developer tools of most browsers) are better for that).</p>

<p>Do note that it has several <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html#predefined"" rel=""noreferrer"">predefined formatters</a> for the more popular patterns. So instead of e.g. <code>DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(&quot;EEE, d MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss Z&quot;, Locale.ENGLISH);</code>, you could use <code>DateTimeFormatter.RFC_1123_DATE_TIME</code>. This is possible because they are, on the contrary to <code>SimpleDateFormat</code>, thread safe. You could thus also define your own, if necessary.</p>
<p>For a particular input string format, you don't need to use an explicit <code>DateTimeFormatter</code>: a standard <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601"" rel=""noreferrer"">ISO 8601</a> date, like 2016-09-26T17:44:57Z, can be parsed directly with <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/LocalDateTime.html#parse-java.lang.CharSequence-"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>LocalDateTime#parse(text)</code></a> as it already uses the <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html#ISO_LOCAL_DATE_TIME"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ISO_LOCAL_DATE_TIME</code></a> formatter. Similarly, <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/LocalDate.html#parse-java.lang.CharSequence-"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>LocalDate#parse(text)</code></a> parses an ISO date without the time component (see <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html#ISO_LOCAL_DATE"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ISO_LOCAL_DATE</code></a>), and <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/ZonedDateTime.html#parse-java.lang.CharSequence-"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ZonedDateTime#parse(text)</code></a> parses an ISO date with an offset and time zone added (see <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html#ISO_ZONED_DATE_TIME"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ISO_ZONED_DATE_TIME</code></a>).</p>
<hr />
<h2>Pre-Java 8</h2>
<p>In case you're not on Java 8 yet, or are forced to use <code>java.util.Date</code>, then format the date using <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>SimpleDateFormat</code></a> using a format pattern matching the input string.</p>

<pre><code>String string = &quot;January 2, 2010&quot;;
DateFormat format = new SimpleDateFormat(&quot;MMMM d, yyyy&quot;, Locale.ENGLISH);
Date date = format.parse(string);
System.out.println(date); // Sat Jan 02 00:00:00 GMT 2010
</code></pre>
<p>Note the importance of the explicit <code>Locale</code> argument. If you omit it, then it will use the <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Locale.html#getDefault--"" rel=""noreferrer"">default locale</a> which is not necessarily English as used in the month name of the input string. If the locale doesn't match with the input string, then you would confusingly get a <code>java.text.ParseException</code> even though when the format pattern seems valid.</p>

In other words, you should never declare and assign it as a static or instance variable and then reuse it from different methods/threads.

1255015,2,,28002,8/10/2009 13:50,,1791,,"<h2>static_cast</h2>
<p><code>static_cast</code> is used for cases where you basically want to reverse an implicit conversion, with a few restrictions and additions. <code>static_cast</code> performs no runtime checks. This should be used if you know that you refer to an object of a specific type, and thus a check would be unnecessary. Example:</p>
<pre><code>void func(void *data) {
  // Conversion from MyClass* -&gt; void* is implicit
  MyClass *c = static_cast&lt;MyClass*&gt;(data);
  ...
}

int main() {
  MyClass c;
  start_thread(&amp;func, &amp;c)  // func(&amp;c) will be called
      .join();
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, you know that you passed a <code>MyClass</code> object, and thus there isn't any need for a runtime check to ensure this.</p>
<h2>dynamic_cast</h2>
<p><code>dynamic_cast</code> is useful when you don't know what the dynamic type of the object is. It returns a null pointer if the object referred to doesn't contain the type casted to as a base class (when you cast to a reference, a <code>bad_cast</code> exception is thrown in that case).</p>
<pre><code>if (JumpStm *j = dynamic_cast&lt;JumpStm*&gt;(&amp;stm)) {
  ...
} else if (ExprStm *e = dynamic_cast&lt;ExprStm*&gt;(&amp;stm)) {
  ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can <strong>not</strong> use <code>dynamic_cast</code> for downcast (casting to a derived class) <strong>if</strong> the argument type is not polymorphic. For example, the following code is not valid, because <code>Base</code> doesn't contain any virtual function:</p>
<pre><code>struct Base { };
struct Derived : Base { };
int main() {
  Derived d; Base *b = &amp;d;
  dynamic_cast&lt;Derived*&gt;(b); // Invalid
}
</code></pre>
<p>An &quot;up-cast&quot; (cast to the base class) is always valid with both <code>static_cast</code> and <code>dynamic_cast</code>, and also without any cast, as an &quot;up-cast&quot; is an implicit conversion (assuming the base class is accessible, i.e. it's a <code>public</code> inheritance).</p>
<h2>Regular Cast</h2>
<p>These casts are also called C-style cast. A C-style cast is basically identical to trying out a range of sequences of C++ casts, and taking the first C++ cast that works, without ever considering <code>dynamic_cast</code>. Needless to say, this is much more powerful as it combines all of <code>const_cast</code>, <code>static_cast</code> and <code>reinterpret_cast</code>, but it's also unsafe, because it does not use <code>dynamic_cast</code>.</p>
<p>In addition, C-style casts not only allow you to do this, but they also allow you to safely cast to a private base-class, while the &quot;equivalent&quot; <code>static_cast</code> sequence would give you a compile-time error for that.</p>
<p>Some people prefer C-style casts because of their brevity. I use them for numeric casts only, and use the appropriate C++ casts when user defined types are involved, as they provide stricter checking.</p>

8539107,2,,2717480,12/16/2011 19:21,,1778,,"<p>This is one of the most well-known examples of authors misunderstanding how <code>:first-child</code> works. <a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html#first-child"" rel=""noreferrer"">Introduced in CSS2</a>, the <code>:first-child</code> pseudo-class represents <strong>the very first child of its parent</strong>. That's it. There's a very common misconception that it picks up whichever child element is the first to match the conditions specified by the rest of the compound selector. Due to the way selectors work (see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5545649/can-i-combine-nth-child-or-nth-of-type-with-an-arbitrary-selector/5546296#5546296"">here</a> for an explanation), that is simply not true.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#first-of-type-pseudo"" rel=""noreferrer"">Selectors level 3 introduces a <code>:first-of-type</code> pseudo-class</a>, which represents the first element among siblings of its element type. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24657555/what-is-the-difference-between-first-child-and-first-of-type/24657721#24657721"">This answer</a> explains, with illustrations, the difference between <code>:first-child</code> and <code>:first-of-type</code>. However, as with <code>:first-child</code>, it does not look at any other conditions or attributes. In HTML, the element type is represented by the tag name. In the question, that type is <code>p</code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no similar <code>:first-of-class</code> pseudo-class for matching the first child element of a given class. At the time this answer was first posted, <a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-selectors4-20110929/#nth-match"" rel=""noreferrer"">the newly published FPWD of Selectors level 4 introduced an <code>:nth-match()</code> pseudo-class</a>, designed around existing selector mechanics as I mentioned in the first paragraph by adding a selector-list argument, through which you can supply the rest of the compound selector to get the desired filtering behavior. In recent years this functionality was <a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-4/#the-nth-child-pseudo"" rel=""noreferrer"">subsumed into <code>:nth-child()</code> itself</a>, with the selector list appearing as an optional second argument, to simplify things as well as averting the false impression that <code>:nth-match()</code> matched across the entire document (see the final note below).</p>
<p>While we await <a href=""https://caniuse.com/css-nth-child-of"" rel=""noreferrer"">cross-browser support</a> (seriously, it's been nearly 10 years, and there has only been a single implementation for the last 5 of those years), one workaround that <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5287272/css-select-first-element-with-a-certain-class/5293095#5293095"">Lea Verou</a> and I developed independently (she did it first!) is to first apply your desired styles to <em>all</em> your elements with that class:</p>

<p>... then &quot;undo&quot; the styles for elements with the class that <em>come after the first one</em>, using <a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/#general-sibling-combinators"" rel=""noreferrer"">the general sibling combinator <code>~</code></a> in an overriding rule:</p>
<pre class=""lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>/* 
 * Select all but the first .red child of .home,
 * and remove the border from the previous rule.
 */
.home &gt; .red ~ .red {
    border: none;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now only the first element with <code>class=&quot;red&quot;</code> will have a border.</p>
<p>Here's an illustration of how the rules are applied:</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""false"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>.home &gt; .red {
    border: 1px solid red;
}

.home &gt; .red ~ .red {
    border: none;
}</code></pre>
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div class=""home""&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;blah&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;!-- [1] --&gt;
  &lt;p class=""red""&gt;first&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;!-- [2] --&gt;
  &lt;p class=""red""&gt;second&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- [3] --&gt;
  &lt;p class=""red""&gt;third&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;!-- [3] --&gt;
  &lt;p class=""red""&gt;fourth&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- [3] --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>No rules are applied; no border is rendered.</strong><br />
This element does not have the class <code>red</code>, so it's skipped.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Only the first rule is applied; a red border is rendered.</strong><br />
This element has the class <code>red</code>, but it's not preceded by any elements with the class <code>red</code> in its parent. Thus the second rule is not applied, only the first, and the element keeps its border.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Both rules are applied; no border is rendered.</strong><br />
This element has the class <code>red</code>. It is also preceded by at least one other element with the class <code>red</code>. Thus both rules are applied, and the second <code>border</code> declaration overrides the first, thereby &quot;undoing&quot; it, so to speak.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As a bonus, although it was introduced in Selectors 3, the general sibling combinator is actually pretty well-supported by IE7 and newer, unlike <code>:first-of-type</code> and <code>:nth-of-type()</code> which are only supported by IE9 onward. If you need good browser support, you're in luck.</p>
<p>In fact, the fact that the sibling combinator is the only important component in this technique, <em>and</em> it has such amazing browser support, makes this technique very versatile — you can adapt it for filtering elements by other things, besides class selectors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can use this to work around <code>:first-of-type</code> in IE7 and IE8, by simply supplying a type selector instead of a class selector (again, more on its incorrect usage in the question in a later section):</p>
 <pre class=""lang-css prettyprint-override""><code> article &gt; p {
     /* Apply styles to article &gt; p:first-of-type, which may or may not be :first-child */
 }

 article &gt; p ~ p {
     /* Undo the above styles for every subsequent article &gt; p */
 }
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>You can filter by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7128406/css-select-the-first-child-from-elements-with-particular-attribute/7128429#7128429"">attribute selectors</a> or any other simple selectors instead of classes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can also combine this overriding technique with <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8535686/first-child-not-working/8535800#8535800"">pseudo-elements</a> even though pseudo-elements technically aren't simple selectors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that in order for this to work, you will need to know in advance what the default styles will be for your other sibling elements so you can override the first rule. Additionally, since this involves overriding rules in CSS, you can't achieve the same thing with a single selector for use with the <a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-api"" rel=""noreferrer"">Selectors API</a>, or <a href=""https://www.selenium.dev"" rel=""noreferrer"">Selenium</a>'s CSS locators.</p>
<p>On a final note, keep in mind that this answer assumes that the question is looking for <em>any number of</em> first child elements having a given class. There is neither a pseudo-class nor even a generic CSS solution for the nth match of a complex selector <em>across the entire document</em> — whether a solution exists depends heavily on the document structure. jQuery provides <code>:eq()</code>, <code>:first</code>, <code>:last</code> and more for this purpose, but note again that <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9983297/difference-between-css-selector-and-jquery-filter/10835694#10835694"">they function very differently from <code>:nth-child()</code> et al</a>. Using the Selectors API, you can either use <code>document.querySelector()</code> to obtain the very first match:</p>
<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>var first = document.querySelector('.home &gt; .red');
</code></pre>
<p>Or use <code>document.querySelectorAll()</code> with an indexer to pick any specific match:</p>
<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>var redElements = document.querySelectorAll('.home &gt; .red');
var first = redElements[0];
var second = redElements[1];
// etc
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>Although the <code>.red:nth-of-type(1)</code> solution in the original accepted answer by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2717480/css-selector-for-first-element-with-class/2717515#2717515"">Philip Daubmeier</a> works (which was originally written by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/264276/martyn"">Martyn</a> but deleted since), it does not behave the way you'd expect it to.</p>
<p>For example, if you only wanted to select the <code>p</code> here:</p>
<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;p class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>... then you can't use <code>.red:first-of-type</code> (equivalent to <code>.red:nth-of-type(1)</code>), because each element is the first (and only) one of its type (<code>p</code> and <code>div</code> respectively), so <em>both</em> will be matched by the selector.</p>
<p>When the first element of a certain class <em>is also the first of its type</em>, the pseudo-class will work, but <strong>this happens only by coincidence</strong>. This behavior is demonstrated in Philip's answer. The moment you stick in an element of the same type before this element, the selector will fail. Taking the markup from the question:</p>
<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div class=&quot;home&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;blah&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;first&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;second&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;third&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;fourth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Applying a rule with <code>.red:first-of-type</code> will work, but once you add another <code>p</code> without the class:</p>
<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div class=&quot;home&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;blah&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;dummy&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;first&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;second&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;third&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;fourth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>... the selector will immediately fail, because the first <code>.red</code> element is now the <em>second</em> <code>p</code> element.</p>

21694054,2,,21692193,2/11/2014 5:43,,1776,,"<p>There are some good answers here. I would add to them the following points.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the correct C# way of representing a data structure, which, &quot;logically&quot; (that is to say, &quot;to the human mind&quot;) is just a list of things with a few bells and whistles?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ask any ten non-computer-programmer people who are familiar with the existence of football to fill in the blank:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A football team is a particular kind of _____</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did <em>anyone</em> say &quot;list of football players with a few bells and whistles&quot;, or did they all say &quot;sports team&quot; or &quot;club&quot; or &quot;organization&quot;?  Your notion that a football team is <em>a particular kind of list of players</em> is in your human mind and your human mind alone.</p>
<p><code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> is a <em>mechanism</em>.  Football team is a <em>business object</em> -- that is, an object that represents some concept that is in the <em>business domain</em> of the program. Don't mix those! A football team <em>is a kind of</em> team; it <em>has a</em> roster, a roster <em>is a list of players</em>. A roster is not a <em>particular kind of list of players</em>. A roster <em>is</em> a list of players. So make a property called <code>Roster</code> that is a <code>List&lt;Player&gt;</code>. And make it <code>ReadOnlyList&lt;Player&gt;</code> while you're at it, unless you believe that everyone who knows about a football team gets to delete players from the roster.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is inheriting from <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> always unacceptable?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unacceptable to whom? Me? No.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When is it acceptable?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you're building a mechanism that <em>extends the <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> mechanism</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What must a programmer consider, when deciding whether to inherit from <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> or not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Am I building a <em>mechanism</em> or a <em>business object</em>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But that's a lot of code! What do I get for all that work?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You spent more time typing up your question that it would have taken you to write forwarding methods for the relevant members of <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> fifty times over. You're clearly not afraid of verbosity, and we are talking about a very small amount of code here; this is a few minutes work.</p>
<h2>UPDATE</h2>
<p>I gave it some more thought and there is another reason to not model a football team as a list of players. In fact it might be a bad idea to model a football team as <em>having</em> a list of players too. The problem with a team as/having a list of players is that what you've got is a <em>snapshot</em> of the team <em>at a moment in time</em>. I don't know what your business case is for this class, but if I had a class that represented a football team I would want to ask it questions like &quot;how many Seahawks players missed games due to injury between 2003 and 2013?&quot; or &quot;What Denver player who previously played for another team had the largest year-over-year increase in yards ran?&quot; or &quot;<a href=""http://theoatmeal.com/comics/working_home"" rel=""noreferrer"">Did the Piggers go all the way this year?</a>&quot;</p>
<p>That is, a football team seems to me to be well modeled as <em>a collection of historical facts</em> such as when a player was recruited, injured, retired, etc. Obviously the current player roster is an important fact that should probably be front-and-center, but there may be other interesting things you want to do with this object that require a more historical perspective.</p>

263416,2,,263400,11/4/2008 20:56,,1771,,"<p>I usually go with something like the implementation given in Josh Bloch's <em>fabulous</em> <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0321356683"" rel=""noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Effective Java</a>. It's fast and creates a pretty good hash which is unlikely to cause collisions. Pick two different prime numbers, e.g. 17 and 23, and do:</p>
<pre><code>public override int GetHashCode()
{
    unchecked // Overflow is fine, just wrap
    {
        int hash = 17;
        // Suitable nullity checks etc, of course :)
        hash = hash * 23 + field1.GetHashCode();
        hash = hash * 23 + field2.GetHashCode();
        hash = hash * 23 + field3.GetHashCode();
        return hash;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>As noted in comments, you may find it's better to pick a large prime to multiply by instead. Apparently 486187739 is good... and although most examples I've seen with small numbers tend to use primes, there are at least similar algorithms where non-prime numbers are often used. In the not-quite-<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function"" rel=""noreferrer"">FNV</a> example later, for example, I've used numbers which apparently work well - but the initial value isn't a prime. (The multiplication constant <em>is</em> prime though. I don't know quite how important that is.)</p>
<p>This is better than the common practice of <code>XOR</code>ing hashcodes for two main reasons. Suppose we have a type with two <code>int</code> fields:</p>
<pre><code>XorHash(x, x) == XorHash(y, y) == 0 for all x, y
XorHash(x, y) == XorHash(y, x) for all x, y
</code></pre>
<p>By the way, the earlier algorithm is the one currently used by the C# compiler for anonymous types.</p>
<p><a href=""http://eternallyconfuzzled.com/tuts/algorithms/jsw_tut_hashing.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">This page</a> gives quite a few options. I think for most cases the above is &quot;good enough&quot; and it's incredibly easy to remember and get right. The <a href=""http://eternallyconfuzzled.com/tuts/algorithms/jsw_tut_hashing.aspx#fnv"" rel=""noreferrer"">FNV</a> alternative is similarly simple, but uses different constants and <code>XOR</code> instead of <code>ADD</code> as a combining operation. It looks <em>something</em> like the code below, but the normal FNV algorithm operates on individual bytes, so this would require modifying to perform one iteration per byte, instead of per 32-bit hash value. FNV is also designed for variable lengths of data, whereas the way we're using it here is always for the same number of field values. Comments on this answer suggest that the code here doesn't actually work as well (in the sample case tested) as the addition approach above.</p>
<pre><code>// Note: Not quite FNV!
public override int GetHashCode()
{
    unchecked // Overflow is fine, just wrap
    {
        int hash = (int) 2166136261;
        // Suitable nullity checks etc, of course :)
        hash = (hash * 16777619) ^ field1.GetHashCode();
        hash = (hash * 16777619) ^ field2.GetHashCode();
        hash = (hash * 16777619) ^ field3.GetHashCode();
        return hash;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that one thing to be aware of is that ideally you should prevent your equality-sensitive (and thus hashcode-sensitive) state from changing after adding it to a collection that depends on the hash code.</p>
<p>As per the <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object.gethashcode#notes-to-inheritors"" rel=""noreferrer"">documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can override GetHashCode for immutable reference types. In general, for mutable reference types, you should override GetHashCode only if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can compute the hash code from fields that are not mutable; or</li>
<li>You can ensure that the hash code of a mutable object does not change while the object is contained in a collection that relies on its hash code.</li>
</ul>
